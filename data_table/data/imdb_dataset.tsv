Michael Burry an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager has traded traditional office attire for shorts bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burry's beliefs. An errant telephone call to FrontPoint Partners gets this information into the hands of Mark Baum an idealist who is fed up with the corruption in the financial industry. Baum and his associates who work at an arms length under Morgan Stanley decide to join forces with Vennett despite not totally trusting him. In addition to Burry's information they further believe that most of the mortgages are overrated by the bond agencies with the banks collating all the sub-prime mortgages under AAA packages. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley who are minor players in a $30 million start-up garage company called Brownfield get a hold of Vennett's prospectus on the matter. Wanting in on the action but not having the official clout to play they decide to call an old "friend" retired investment banker Ben Rickert to help out. All three of these groups work on the premise that the banks are stupid and don't know what's going on while for them to win the general economy has to lose which means the suffering of the general investor who trusts the financial institutions. That latter aspect may not sit well with Baum. Some of these assumptions may be incorrect and may be far more manipulative than they could have ever imagined which in turn may throw curves into the process.

He goes to Addison Cola Company where he maneuvers a meeting with a formidable marketing executive Six by triggering the fire alarm. While mediocre she tells him that she and her team will polish it before it is presented to the board. During the meeting the board shows some resistance but Six informs them that Scat is willing to give up trademark provisions for a mere two million. Scat then realizes he has not reserved the trademark and scrambles to the Patent and Trademark Office only to find out that his roommate Sneaky Pete stole his idea and registered it earlier that morning. Success befalls Pete as 'FUKK' becomes the highest selling energy drink in the nation. Embittered Scat goes back to his ordinary life but is later recruited by Six to help her come up with a new ad campaign after she is booted off the 'FUKK' campaign and relegated to Addy Classics. Instructed to come up with a brilliant idea by Friday (only five days away) Scat moves in with Six and is unable to think of anything until only moments before the deadline. After shaking a vending machine in frustration and Six telling him that twelve people have died by being crushed by vending machines he comes up with the idea of 'Wouldn't you die for a Fukk' advertising a cartoon where people die by being crushed by vending machines because they want the drink so badly. The ad is accepted and aired but a young teenager dies by being crushed by a vending machine and the ad is now considered insensitive and taken off air. Scat and Six attend the funeral and when Scat makes a speech Six points out that all the mourners are actors that she recognizes from ads. Scat quickly realizes that Sneaky Pete created this fake death to get their ad to fail and he quickly pulls out the fake body from the coffin and holds it up for all to see. Scat is fired while believing that Six remains at the company. In reality Six quit when Addison refused to keep Scat now working at a shoe store. After a brief stint as a rickshaw driver Scat is hired by a rival company and Six is also poached. The two must come up with a new drink idea and after talking about their attraction for each other Scat comes up with the idea of 'Average KOK'. He presents this as a drink to the board and also thinks of a different drink just called 'KOK' that they give to celebrities. The normal 'KOK's are numbered up to 100 and each number represents a celebrity and the celebrity deems who can drink their numbered drink. After the frenzy for the drink that they can't have Scat and the company decide to make the drink go public but not before the suicide of a teenager who killed himself after not being 'cool' enough to drink his lucky number 17's corresponding drink. After confirming that this time the death is real Scat goes on TV to apologize but ends up pointing out that drink sales have never been higher even after the death and that people like him 'have a dream'.

Lovelace (2013)	Rob (I) Epstein	6.2	31334	2013	Biography	356582	10000000	93	James Franco	192	M	Amanda Seyfried	470	F	Wes Bentley	558	M	Juno Temple	561	F	Peter Sarsgaard	1293	M	Robert Patrick	1294	M	Events surrounding Linda's relationship with Chuck and the production of Deep Throat are portrayed twice. The first portrayal includes no violence or intimidation making her life look perfect but the second portrayal reveals the truth and what really happened including scenes of domestic abuse and intimidation by Traynor. In 1970 20-year-old Linda Lovelace (Amanda Seyfried) is living with her overbearing parents in Davie Florida. While out dancing one night with her best friend Patsy (Juno Temple) she attracts the attention of Chuck Traynor (Peter Sarsgaard) and the two soon develop a serious relationship. He is much older than her and begins teaching her how to perform sexual acts which she is initially thrilled about. After breaking a curfew one night Linda is slapped by her mother (Sharon Stone) so she decides to move out and live with Chuck later marrying him. During a party Linda watches one of Chuck's homemade porno films for the first time and tells him that good girls like her don't do stuff like that. Six months later Linda bails Chuck out of jail for soliciting prostitution which he refuses to talk about with her. Desperate for money he later persuades Linda to become a pornographic film actress and she soon begins working on the film Deep Throat where she first uses her stage name Linda Lovelace. The movie becomes a huge hit raking in over $30000 at the box office in its first week. After it becomes a worldwide phenomenon Linda is interviewed by a variety of print and radio reporters and becomes the subject of late night television humor much to the disgrace of her estranged parents. Her life is seen as exciting and glamorous: she poses nude for photoshoots and attends swanky parties weekly. During a private screening in Los Angeles Hugh Hefner (James Franco) convinces Linda that she has the potential to be more than a porn actress. In the second version of events Chuck's violent nature is gradually exposed and Linda's life is revealed not to be as perfect as it seems. He chokes Linda during sex and refuses to stop when she asks claiming it to be "passion" and forces her into prostitution at gunpoint. Linda visits her parents to ask if she can move back for a while after she reveals that Chuck has been hitting her but her mom says no tells her to go home and be a good wife since she must have done something to deserve his abuse. It appears that Linda no longer loves him like earlier but has no other choice. After Chuck learns that Linda has been discussing a new salary with the movie's director Gerard Damiano (Hank Azaria) without telling him he punishes her by making her shower in freezing water. When Deep Throat becomes a hit Chuck tries to persuade Linda to do another porn film but she refuses. He then takes her to a party and forces Linda to participate in a gang bang at a hotel again at gunpoint for the money instead. She attempts to escape from him that night but he catches her and ends up sleeping on top of her so she can't try again during the night. The following day she secretly meets up with Anthony Romano (Chris Noth) and tells him she wants out of the porno business revealing the facial bruises and cuts inflicted by Chuck. Disgusted Romano has her checked into a private hotel while he and his bodyguards whip Traynor for abusing Linda and for the $25000 he owes. Six years later following her divorce to Chuck Linda marries Larry Marchiano moves to Long Island and has a son by him. She later takes a polygraph test before publishing her autobiography Ordeal which details years of Chuck physically and sexually abusing her as well as taking all of her earnings. Linda appears on Donahue with her distraught parents breaking down in tears while watching her on TV. A few days later the Marchianos travel to Florida for Linda to reconcile with her parents. Closing captions reveal that while Deep Throat made over $600 million worldwide Linda only earned $1250 because Chuck controlled the money like he controlled everything. Ordeal went on to sell out three printings and for 20 years Linda spoke out against pornography and domestic violence. Chuck later went on to marry Marilyn Chambers another porn actress. Linda died at age 53 from injuries sustained in a car accident in 2002 and Traynor suffered a fatal heart attack three months later. A picture of Linda is shown right before the ending credits.

High-Rise (2015)	Ben (I) Wheatley	5.7	19938	2015	Drama	323899	6100000	119	Luke Evans	52	M	Tom Hiddleston	283	M	Keeley Hawes	540	F	Sienna Miller	838	F	Augustus Prew	947	M	Sienna Guillory	1144	F	The film opens with Dr. Robert Laing (Tom Hiddleston) living in a ravaged tower block killing a white Siberian husky and spit roasting it. The film flashes back to three months ago when life was more typical. The forty story high-rise tower on the outskirts of London built by esteemed architect Anthony Royal (Jeremy Irons) is the epitome of chic modern living. The upper echelons of society live in the top floors while more common families live in the lower ones. The high-rise provides its tenants with a swimming pool gym spa supermarket and even a primary school. There is little reason to leave the building outside of working hours and its occupants gradually become isolated from the outside world. Laing moves into an apartment on the 25th floor after his sister dies. He begins a relationship with single mother Charlotte Melville (Sienna Miller) and becomes a fatherly figure to her son Toby (Louis Suc). He also becomes friends with Richard Wilder (Luke Evans) and his heavily-pregnant wife Helen (Elisabeth Moss) who live in a low-level apartment with their children. Laing works at a school of physiology. While he is cracking open a severed head a student named Munrow (Augustus Prew) faints. Having taken a fall he is given brain scans as a precaution. The next day Laing is taken to the 40th story penthouse to meet Royal he finds an opulent rooftop garden and is invited to a party being thrown by Royal's snobby wife Ann (Keeley Hawes). The party turns out to be an 18th-century costume party and Laing's everyday suit is ridiculed by Ann and other guests including Munrow who also lives in the building. Laing is thrown out of the party and becomes trapped in an elevator during a power cut. Such outages are becoming common along with water being shut off and garbage chutes becoming blocked much to the annoyance of the lower-floor residents. During a game of squash Royal tells Laing that these are simply the growing pains of a new building. Laing receives Munrow's brain scans which come back clean. However still angry about his humiliation the vengeful Laing tells Munrow that they may have "found something". Another power out in the high-rise leads to a night of decadent partying in the hallways and apartments. A drunken and distressed Munrow commits suicide by jumping off the 39th floor crashing onto the bonnet of a car. Wilder finds it suspicious that no police show up to the scene and becomes intent on exposing the injustices of the high-rise. Law and order begin to disintegrate in the building due to the failing infrastructure and increasing tensions between floors. Violence becomes commonplace food from the supermarket becomes scarce and the building devolves into class warfare between floors. Garbage bags are piled high in the fire and there are spot-fires and graffiti through the lower floors. It is implied that Royal has been bribing authorities to ignore the chaos within the high-rise. Feeling guilty about Munrow's suicide Laing shows signs of mental disturbance eventually barricading himself in his apartment and settling into the chaotic atmosphere even having sexual intercourse with Helen. Wilder waking up from a fight with upper-floor residents intends to find and kill Royal believing him to be the cause of what has happened within the high-rise. Acquiring a gun from the Royal's former housekeeper Wilder also finds that Charlotte is Royal's aide and that Toby is Royal's illegitimate child. Breaking into Charlotte's apartment Wilder tortures and rapes Charlotte for information on Royal. The only resident who leaves the building for work upper-floor resident and television newsreader Cosgrove (Peter Ferdinando) is captured and killed by a gang of lower-floor residents. Some upper-floor residents ask Laing to lobotomize Wilder as they believe he is a dangerous agitator causing the majority of the chaos in the building. After Laing conducts a psychiatric examination he refuses saying that Wilder is "possibly the sanest man in the building". Laing is nearly thrown off the building to his death for this but Royal steps in and saves him. Laing and Royal talk about the failure and arguable success of the high rise that it is a "crucible for change" and could lead to "new developments" as well as giving the residents the opportunity to escape to a new life. The women at the top begin working on a plan to establish new management of the building and Helen gives birth to her overdue baby. Wilder manages to make his way to the penthouse and shoots Royal dead after a scuffle. He is then killed by Royal's harem of women as Toby looks on through his kaleidoscope. The film ends as it began in the ravaged high-rise. Violence has abated somewhat now that many residents lie dead as well as many of the apartments in ruin. Laing appears to have gone insane speaking about himself and to others in the third person and talking to the building. Laing then lies down with Charlotte reflecting that what has happened will eventually reach the second tower of the high-rise development. The film ends with Toby listening to a radio broadcast of Margaret Thatcher saying that where there is state capitalism there can never be political freedom.

A company called Zomcon has been able to control the zombie population. Zombies can be temporarily neutralized by being shot but can only be permanently neutralized by their brain being destroyed. Their ultimate disposal is through cremation or burial the latter which requires decapitation with the head being buried separately from the body. Conversely Zomcon has created the domestication collar when activated and placed on a zombie makes the zombie controllable and thus an eternally productive creature within society. Because all dead initially become zombies the elderly are viewed negatively and suspectly. And all people adult or child learn to shoot to kill to protect society. Zomcon is the go to organization for all things zombie. In the town of Willard the Robinsons - father Bill mother Helen and adolescent son Timmy - are one family who don't own a zombie as a domestic since Bill is afraid of zombies as when he was a child he had to shoot his own zombie father who tried to eat him. Bill has thus become fascinated with funerals to see zombies put away permanently. But Helen feels pressured to get a zombie when Zomcon's new head of security in Willard the officious Jonathan Bottoms moves into the neighborhood with his family. Never having had to deal with a zombie directly Timmy is initially wary of their zombie. But as a lonely child who has no friends and is often bullied Timmy eventually befriends their zombie who he names Fido as he treats the zombie much like a faithful pet dog. Timmy protects Fido at all cost even after Fido due to no fault of its own is implicated in some deaths which creates a mini-wave of loose zombies unknown to Zomcon. But Fido may play a larger role within the family as a companion for Helen who is largely neglected by Bill since he sees human affection as ultimately resulting in such difficult issues as what happened between him and his own father. With Timmy and Helen treating Fido with kindness Fido in turn may prove that not all zombies even when without their domestication collar are out to kill anyone and everyone in their path.

Jackson	581	M	Kiefer Sutherland	624	M	Kevin Spacey	726	M	Ashley Judd	1017	F	In Canton Mississippi 10-year-old Tonya Hailey is viciously brutalized by two white racist rednecks -- James Louis "Pete" Willard and Billy Ray Cobb. Almost immediately after Tonya is found and rushed to a hospital Pete and Billy Ray are found at a roadside bar where they had been bragging about what they did to Tonya. Tonya's understandably distraught and enraged father Carl Lee Hailey remembers a case from a year ago when four white men raped an African-American girl in a nearby town and got acquitted. Carl is determined to not let that happen in this case. While deputy Dwayne Powell Looney is escorting Pete and Billy Ray up a flight of stairs to a court room Carl emerges from the building's basement with an assault rifle and he kills Pete and Billy Ray for what they did to Tonya. Carl is later arrested at his house by African-American sheriff Ozzie Walls and Carl is scheduled to be placed on trial. Despite the efforts of the NAACP and local African-American leaders to persuade Carl to choose some of their high-powered attorneys Carl wants to be represented by his friend Jake Tyler Brigance who has a wife named Carla and a daughter named Hannah. Presiding over the trial is white judge Omar Noose and the prosecution attorney is Rufus Buckley who would like nothing more than to win the case and swim in the publicity that a win would generate because Rufus realizes that a murder conviction could help him gain higher office. Helping Jake on the case are his former law professor Lucien Wilbanks fellow attorney Harry Rex Vonner and law student Ellen Roark.

Twenty years later Justin (Jamie Kennedy) is still in a coma. The doctors tell his desperate parents that at this point there is little sign that Justin will recover and they decide to pull the plug on him. As his parents say goodbye and leave however a janitor rolls by with a radio playing the same song from the 1986 talent competition "Rockit" by Herbie Hancock which jars his brain to function waking him from his 20-year coma. Justin now finds himself suddenly 32 years old his parents bankrupt from overdue life support payments and Jennifer (Maria Menounos) who has become a girls' dance instructor engaged to Kip (Michael Rosenbaum). Kip is now an obnoxious promoter and is set to host a breakdance contest broadcast on national television with a grand prize of $100000. Justin realizes that the money could help him repay his parents for what they've spent on his medical bills. Kip is sarcastic and still despises Justin and schemes to keep him off the show and away from Jennifer.

Nunez Jr.). Darnell who is now both a toy store employee and a failed inventor frequently slapped around by his wife explains much of what has changed in the past 20 years to Justin before introducing him to the rest of the crew. Aki (Bobby Lee) is an accountant and has lost his old stereotypical Asian accent thanks to English classes; he is also trying to woo a colleague who claims he might have a 2% chance of sleeping with her if he were a professional breakdancer. Hector (Aris Alvarado) is now a meter maid and is even more overweight than he was in school. Despite their reluctance to return to the '80s lifestyle they agree to try to retrain their faded breakdancing skills to help Justin. Initially the four are terrible but their skills improve greatly with Justin's help as Aki studies a Robosapien toy to reclaim his mastery of the robot. Justin and Jennifer begin reminiscing about the old days and he eventually asks her on a date which she thinks is just still a harmless crush. However with the help of the Internet and practicing on Hector wearing a bra Justin learns how to please a woman quite well. A surprise appearance by David Hasselhoff allows the pair to go on a date in KITT from Knight Rider; however just as Justin has her shirt off and is making his move Kip calls and Jennifer is reminded that she is still engaged to him and runs off embarrassed. During a rather sour birthday party celebration Justin is confronted by the diminutive but talented Cole (Jesse Brown) of the Iced Cole Crew a group hired by Kip to ensure that the Funky Fresh Boyz don't win the contest. Cole challenges Justin to a dance-off in the parking lot and after Cole's impressive routine a nervous and depressed Justin vomits on Cole and runs off too disillusioned to compete on the show. The rest of the Boyz decide to have a breakdancing homeless man stand in for him. Kip gloats to Jennifer about his psychological victory over Justin causing her to finally break up with him. As the dance tournament progresses the Funky Fresh Boyz and the Iced Cole Crew each progress in their individual brackets toward the finals. Jennifer finds Justin sulking in a local bar and convinces him that she wants to be with him and to come back to compete in the show. Justin convinces his worried parents that he will be alright reciting the lyrics to the theme song from Diff'rent Strokes as an inspirational speech. Although Kip tries to prevent him from dancing Jennifer stirs the crowd and Cole into letting him dance and the FFB get the win when Justin is able to successfully complete the headspin maneuver from '86. Kip is outraged and has a huge tantrum leading to him challenging Justin to a last dance off but the FFB don't give in. Kip is fired from the network knocked out by a man from earlier in the film for using the word "retarded" and is urinated on by the homeless dancer. The Funky Fresh Boyz win the prize money and Justin marries Jen. In the epilogue she is currently teaching him how to use an iPod though he is having trouble finding out where he puts the cassette tape in. Darnell has invented the 98 store but his wife is still rather abusive towards him. Hector finds work as a Jennifer Lopez impersonator in Las Vegas and Aki marries his co-worker Yu in a lavish Jewish ceremony which has increased his chances of sleeping with her to 3%. Kip never recovered fully from being punched and is a judge on Dancing with the Stars.

Ulman asks to meet her but stands her up later apologizing and offering to pay double the original salary. Samantha accepts and gets a ride to the remote mansion from her best friend Megan (Greta Gerwig) who expresses her distrust. At the house Mr. Ulman pulls her aside and reveals that he does not have any children to be monitored; the babysitting job is to attend to his wife's ailing mother. Samantha balks but finally agrees if he will pay her $400 a significant increase in her pay. Megan immediately leaves citing Ulman's lies and peculiar behavior but she reluctantly promises to pick up Samantha later. Samantha stays after accepting the money. On the way home Megan stops in her car to smoke a cigarette. When her car lighter will not work a stranger (A.J. Bowen) suddenly appears out of nowhere startling her and lights her cigarette for her. When Megan reveals that she is not the babysitter hired by the Ulmans she is abruptly shot and murdered by the stranger.

While cleaning up the mess she discovers a cupboard filled with old family photographs. In one photograph a different family than the Ulmans stands next to the Volvo she and Megan saw upon pulling up to the house. An additional peculiar detail is that the family in the photograph has a young son. This seems unlikely as the Volvo is a new car and Mr. Ulman stated that although they had a child he was now grown. Samantha draws a rash conclusion that Ulman has possibly murdered the original mansion owners and stolen their car. In a panic she dials 911 but eventually manages to calm herself down. The pizza is finally delivered by the stranger who had killed Megan. Drugs in the pizza cause Samantha to pass out just as she discovers activity behind a door leading to the third floor. When she comes to she finds that she has been bound and gagged in the center of a Pentagram. As a lunar eclipse darkens the night sky Mr. and Mrs. Ulman along with the stranger who is actually their son Victor begin a bizarre ritual. Mother (Danielle Noe) is revealed to be a grotesque witch-like figure. As part of the ritual she slices her arm and pours the blood into a goat skull. She uses the blood to draw occult symbols on Samantha's stomach and forehead and forces Samantha to drink her blood from the skull. Samantha manages to escape halfway through the ritual killing Mrs. Ulman and Victor but horrific images begin appearing in her mind. Mr. Ulman chases her out of the house and through a nearby cemetery. There he tells her she was chosen. Samantha threatens him with the gun used to kill Megan but Ulman passively accepts his fate claiming to be a messenger and gloating that she's too late. Instead of shooting him she shoots herself in the head to Ulman's horror. The scene cuts to a broadcast about the strange lunar eclipse the night before which has confounded scientists due to its abrupt ending as Samantha is revealed to be in a hospital bed in bandages. A nurse walks in and pats the unconscious Samantha on the stomach reassuring her that "You will be just fine. Both of you."

Harvey a former US Army cameraman sells them a silent black and white film of Elvis performing live but later returns with an intriguing offer. Harvey takes Ray to Miami Florida to see a film from 1947 showing the autopsy of an alien supposedly killed in a UFO crash in Roswell New Mexico. Harvey wants $30000 for the film. Gary and Ray return to England to look for an investor to give them the money. A Hungarian art dealer Laszlo Voros who is obsessed with crop circles gives Ray the $30000 after Ray convinces Voros that he is telling the truth. Harvey gets the money and gives the film to Ray and Gary. However in the interim the film has "eaten itself" (i.e. degraded from humidity and heat) and is now completely unwatchable so the duo decide to film their own "remake" of the movie in order to remain on the good side of Voros. Based on Ray's memories of the content of the original and with the help of some friends Ray and Gary remake the autopsy film. The film is made using a convincing replica of the dead alien fashioned from a mannequin and meat products from a friend's butcher shop and filmed on a Bell and Howell spring-wound camera turning the living room of Gary's sister Doreen's home into a movie set in the process. Once finished Ray gives a copy of the new film to Voros who believes it to be real. But when Voros hears that the film is going on air worldwide he claims that he never gave his permission for Santilli to distribute the film and demands that they stop the international airings. Good fortune intervenes however when Voros is knocked down and killed by a green Land Rover (supposedly driven by a CIA agent) whilst standing naked in the middle of a crop circle. Amber Fuentes a newswoman eventually tracks down Harvey who demands from Ray and Gary that they help him keep his anonymity. They produce an interview with a homeless man (who coincidentally had been an actor 40 years previously) posing as Harvey making the newswoman believe she is onto the wrong man. The now restored original 1947 film is ultimately returned which Ray had left in the hands of film restoration experts in the hope that the footage could somehow be recovered. Some sections of the film had been repaired and were now watchable. After viewing the film Ray and Gary bury it telling each other that they can't go through with it all over again. Ten years later in 2005 Ray and Gary retell this event to a documentary maker named Morgan Banner.

Her only experience of being in such an environment is going through hostile zone training a few years earlier. Immediately upon her arrival in Afghanistan she realizes that she is ill-prepared emotionally for this assignment not only enduring the dangers of the war itself but also the conditions of everyday life including largely been seen by men as only a "piece of ass" and a distraction despite her being considered average looking back home and not being overtly sexual and being an individual with a small bladder who is nonetheless told to stay hydrated at all times. She is largely assisted in navigating this new life by Tanya Vanderpoel a fellow female western correspondent and Fahim Ahmadzai her Afghan translator guide. As time goes on Kim finds that she not only may have a specific and important voice within the press corps but that she may be losing touch with her life back in the States for good or bad.

Simmons	810	M	Jack Black	985	M	Richard Gere	1368	M	Sidney Poitier	3378	M	Daniel Dae Kim	3524	M	A joint mission of the American FBI and the Russian MVD leads to the death of the younger brother of an Azerbaijani mobster (David Hayman). In retaliation the mobster hires an enigmatic assassin known only by the pseudonym "The Jackal" (Bruce Willis) to kill an unseen target. The Jackal demands $70 million for the job to which the mobster agrees. Meanwhile the MVD capture one of the mafia's henchmen. During interrogation by torture the henchman reveals the name "Jackal". This coupled with the documents recovered from the henchman's briefcase leads the FBI and MVD to assume the target for the retaliatory hit is FBI Director Donald Brown (John Cunningham). As the Jackal begins his preparations for the assassinationutilising a series of disguises and stolen IDs in the processthe FBI learns of one person who can identify him. FBI Deputy Director Carter Preston (Sidney Poitier) and Russian Police Major Valentina Koslova (Diane Venora) turn to a former Irish Republican Army sniper named Declan Mulqueen (Richard Gere) who had a relationship with an ETA militant named Isabella Zancona (Mathilda May) who they believe can identify The Jackal. Mulqueen eventually agrees to help in exchange for their best efforts to get him released from prison. It later transpires that Mulqueen has a personal motive for hunting the Jackal: the assassin wounded Zancona while she was pregnant with Mulqueen's child causing a miscarriage. Zancona provides information that can help identify the Jackal including the fact that he is American and that he had acquired military training in El Salvador. Meanwhile the Jackal arrives in Montreal to pick up the weapon he intends to use for the assassination evading a group of hijackers in the process and hires gunsmith Ian Lamont (Jack Black) to design and build a mount for it. Underestimating the threat represented by the assassin Lamont demands more money in exchange for keeping quiet - and in response is brutally murdered with the very equipment he built. Soon the FBI discovers Lamont's body and with Mulqueen's help deduce that the Jackal intends to utilize an extreme-range heavy machine gun for the assassination. With the help of a Russian mole in the FBI the Jackal realizes that he is being tracked by Mulqueen with assistance from Zancona and he infiltrates Zancona's house after receiving a FBI access code from his insider. Instead of Zancona however he finds Koslova and Agents Witherspoon (J.K. Simmons) and McMurphy (Richard Lineback); promptly killing the latter two while mortally wounding the former. The Jackal taunts Koslova by saying that Mulqueen "can't protect his women" which she repeats to Mulqueen as she dies. As the Jackal makes his final preparations Mulqueen realizes that his target is not Brown but the First Lady (Tess Harper) who is due to give a major public speech. The Jackal now disguised as a police officer plans to shoot the First Lady from his weapon mounted inside his minivan via remote control. Arriving just in time Mulqueen successfully sabotages the Jackal's weapon destroying the vehicle in the process while Preston absorbs a volley of gunfire meant for the First Lady. After a cat-and-mouse chase through the subway and subway tunnels the Jackal takes a young woman hostage only releasing her when he has Mulqueen at his mercy. Unbeknownst to the Jackal however Mulqueen has summoned Zancona who along with Mulqueen shoots the assassin dead. A few days later Preston and Mulqueen stand as the only witnesses to the Jackal's burial in an unmarked grave. Preston reveals that he is going back to Russia to pursue the mobsters who hired the Jackal. It is revealed that Mulqueen's request to be released was denied but that he will likely be moved to a minimum security prison. Preston's heroics in saving the First Lady have made him a golden boy in the FBI: he can now "screw everything else up for the rest of his life and still be untouchable" for which he credits Mulqueen. After exchanging a farewell and knowing his current clout will prevent any real backlash against him Preston turns his back on Mulqueen allowing him to go free.

Lisa Breaux (Rochelle Aytes) one of Madea's nieces is engaged to an abusive and controlling investment banker named Carlos Armstrong (Blair Underwood). While she desperately wants to get out of the engagement her mother Victoria (Lynn Whitfield) urges her to go through with the wedding telling Lisa to avoid doing things that make Carlos angry. Vanessa (Lisa Arrindell Anderson) the other of Madea's nieces who lives with her has two children fathered by two different men neither of whom is involved in their children's lives. Victoria regularly degrades Vanessa for this even referring to her grandchildren as "bastards". Vanessa is successfully though through some struggle wooed by poetry-spouting bus driver Frankie (Boris Kodjoe) who is the single father of a young son and has a passion for painting. As much as Vanessa likes Frankie she is emotionally closed off and has a difficult time trusting him. Lisa eventually leaves Carlos with the intention of calling off the wedding. She temporarily moves in with Madea. Carlos eager to move forward with the wedding dispatches Victoria to bring her back to him. Victoria confronts Carlos about the abuse suggesting that insecurity about his masculinity is causing him to act out and that he needs counseling. It is then revealed that Victoria has stolen from Lisa's trust fund over the years leaving virtually no money left and is now encouraging Lisa to marry Carlos in order to keep up her livelihood. Carlos makes it clear that he will not bail Victoria out unless the wedding goes forward. Victoria goes to Madea's house to fetch Lisa only to end up in a passionate argument with Vanessa who has become aware of Carlos' abuse and is eager to protect her sister. During the confrontation Vanessa reveals a shocking secret to her younger sister: Victoria allowed her second husband (Lisa's father) to rape Vanessa in order to keep him in the marriage. Vanessa states that the sexual abuse occurred on a regular basis after that which as a result left her closed off emotionally and unable to trust the men in her life including Frankie. Even more shockingly Victoria makes no attempt to deny Vanessa's accusations. Instead she rationalizes her actions telling her daughters that they would have been destitute if Lisa's father had left and that after going through a previous divorce with Vanessa's father and working two jobs to support the family afterwards she felt that she deserved better. She even reveals that her own mother a prostitute and drug addict regularly traded her for "ten dollars and a fix" almost mirroring what she'd done with Vanessa and Lisa's father. Victoria then states that she would not allow Vanessa to ruin her happiness and that she would not apologize for the choices she'd made. Victoria then turns on a horrified Lisa demanding that Lisa begin taking care of her financially as she made sure that Lisa had the best of everything while she was growing up. Victoria then leaves and later lies to Lisa and tells her that Carlos has agreed to counseling. Lisa returns to Carlos and resumes her wedding plans. At the family reunion held at the home of ninety-six-year-old Aunt Ruby (Georgia Allen) Vanessa and Victoria get into a physical fight after yet another verbal confrontation. The fight is broken up when the family members are gathered to an old shack the family's ancestors grew up in. The older members of the family are appalled by how the family has turned out and convince them to act better to each other and to themselves. On the day of Lisa's wedding Madea tells her to stand up against Carlos and fight back. When he finds her he asks that he and Lisa be alone. Madea asks Carlos if he'd like something to eat and tells Lisa to give him some grits on the stove making sure to tell Lisa that they're hot. When Madea leaves the room Carlos slaps Lisa in the face but then in retaliation she throws the pot of hot grits in his face burning him badly and then she beats him with a frying pan as Madea listens outside with laughter. She then takes off her ring and throws it at an injured Carlos before leaving. At the church Lisa announces that Carlos had been beating her every day since they were engaged and that the wedding is off. Frankie then asks Vanessa to marry him. She says yes and they're married at the church instead. After the wedding Victoria tells Vanessa that the two are a beautiful couple and they hug signifying the first steps in a possible reconciliation.

However he lets the train rush past him and simply watches. The next scene shows him getting therapy in a brightly coloured room. Don appears to have tuned out the therapist and simply jots down a drawing in his notebook. He then tears the page from his book and walks out the room leaving a puzzled therapist who eyes his drawing which features the therapist going 'bla bla bla bla bla'. Don asks his brother about his relationship with someone who his brother thinks fondly of. His brother seems happy with her. Don is a talented teenager who draws a lot of comic stories and since being told he had terminal cancer has lived in a world occupied by his superhero. Don frequently suffers from hallucinations and during a scan sees a twisted woman (a cartoon and figment of his imagination) laughing hideously at him. In the reception room a boy named Billy won't stop staring at Don. Don is drawing a picture and then rips it out of his book and hands it to Billy getting up and leaving. It is a picture of a boy standing in a hole in a cemetery. Behind him there is a grave with the name 'Billy' written on it. In an effort to stop his suicide attempts his parents send him to therapy. Eventually he is sent to see a psychiatrist Dr. Adrian King (Andy Serkis) one whom he initially does not like; but whom he forms a bond with quickly. Don walks home from school alone and balances on the wall of a bridge as cars rush past below him. He cautiously walks across unaware that he has been spotted by the therapist. Don visually shows the therapist his opinion on his methods when he graffiti's a Skull 'n' Crossbones on his boat. However later Don comes and cleans it off for him and his therapist offers love advice for his crush Shelly. Shelly reads out an essay from her book. Don looks at it and realises she hasn't done her homework and is left amazed. The teacher is on the phone and hasn't been listening to her. On the way out of the classroom Don tells her: 'good essay' and she smiles knowing he knows too. Don turns up at a party where he and his friends perfect a recipe for a drink made from alcoholic wines and beers. Grinning Don takes a sip. On the way home he spots the woman again and it shows him spraying the air with something. In the morning there is graffitied woman on the school window which people crowd around taking pictures of. His parents are infuriated and he has been suspended from school for a week. Eventually he is made to scrub it off and so does so when unexpectedly Shelly kneels down and helps him. Don returns to the therapist and notices a picture of Dr. King's wife who died a while ago. During an English lesson Don and Shelly pass notes between each other and end up deciding to attend a party on the weekend. Don asks his therapist for 'love advice' and attends the party with Shelly. Before the party they both talk on top of a building admiring the view. Shelly tells Don she likes his drawings. Flattered Don tells her she is the smartest girl in the class and really beautiful. Shelly doesn't think that is a 'talent' and would do anything for a talent like Don's. The party goes well until they discover a video of Shelly exposing her breasts and lying on the floor and beginning to strip off her clothes. Some one tells Don his girlfriend is 'dirty' and 'crazy' - intended as a joke. Embarrassed Don claims she is not his girlfriend and they hardly know each other. Then he spots Shelly who has heard what he said. She drives off on her motorbike without him. Don arrives home panicking and heartbroken and is then spotted by his therapist who asks him what's wrong. Don tells him to go away and leave shouting loudly. It results with him having a panic attack and needing to be rushed to the hospital. Don is informed his cancer has got worse and has only a few days left to live. His father decides to spend some time with his son smoking and the two get very emotional. When Don's mother finds out she tells the father to drive him to hospital. Don has a conversation with a younger patient who has cancer too. She claims she wants to be a 'dancer' when she is older. Billy says he'll be a prince and Don reveals he wants to be a superhero. Don's brother confesses to Don's friend that he doesn't want Don to die a virgin. They go around the school asking girls if they'll have sex with Don. All of the say that it sounds gross. Eventually they find some girls who are attractive and willing. Don is embarrassed when they show him pictures of the girls and ask for him to make a pick. Realising they've asked the majority of the girls in the school Don hesitates. However with the help of his therapist they get one to agree. Don is completely nervous during his conversation with them and they stumble across the subject of 'true love'. She then asks for Don to show her some of his pictures. She is impressed and tells him she would do anything for a talent like his. He is reminded of Shelly. In a hallucination he sees the medic woman who tried kill him with a kiss. He leaves her apartment and goes to Shelly and apologizes. The two walk along a beach hand in hand. Don makes her promise that if she's upset at all then she should go there and think of him. She promises. The scene fades and it shows Don on his bed dying in peace. His therapist gets on his sailboat which he has painted and drawn a similar Skull 'n' Crossbones on to what Don drew. Shelly is on the rock and the sailboat sails in the distance. It cuts into the credits.

In the meantime he's got big dreams to pursue on Earth such as landing a slot at the final Amateur Night Contest at the famed Apollo Theatre. Lance's has one little problem though - he ain't that funny. Thanks to an over-cautious emissary from heaven Mr. Keyes he's going to get hit (literally) with a much bigger problem. Showing that even God has difficulty finding good help these days the inept minion mistakenly plucks Lance from a traffic accident - before it takes place. Transporting him to the Pearly Gates or more accurately the velvet roped-lines of the hottest club around the error is finally addressed by Mr. King the streetwise no-nonsense head angel who manages the place from his plush windowed office. Since returning to his own body on Earth is impossible the urban dwelling Lance reluctantly agrees to a normally unthinkable proposal. He'll occupy the body of a wealthy old white mogul Charles Wellington until a more suitable body can be found. Strangely enough in a Park Avenue penthouse servants and butlers become his new homeys as Lance works on his streetwise comedy routine for the big Apollo showdown. Living in the body of a callous old white man would be bizarre enough for Lance without falling in love with Sontee the beautiful woman publicly battling Wellington's company at the same time. And if that wasn't enough he's got to deal with the love affair between Wellington's wife and his personal assistant and their plot to have him killed. Can reincarnation lead to self discovery true love and a better stand up routine? Lance Barton is about to find out.

The company has yet to produce a film Bobby's personal net worth is virtually zero and the company only has $2184 to its name $1 invested into it personally by Bobby every week since he first decided he wanted to make a movie when he was a child. Bobby believes his fortunes will change when his accountant Afrim changes hats and writes a science-fiction alien invasion screenplay that Bobby thinks all studios will clamor for and has Oscar written all over it. He has a small stable of followers who support his vision in being part of this movie which eventually includes Daisy as the lead actress she a stereotypical small town girl looking to make it big in Hollywood. Having just arrived in town she does not know her way around the Hollywood system... except on her proverbial back. Bobby is not averse to telling bald-faced lies in his singular focus in getting the picture made and distributed all on this $2184 as a starting point. It is using several of those lies that he is able to get a verbal confirmation from big studio executive Jerry Renfro to distribute the movie *if* it stars Kit Ramsey arguably the biggest action star in the world. Using similar lies Bobby however is unable to convince Kit to star in the movie. Kit who has a weakness for the Laker Girls is a self-absorbed and paranoid movie star whose life and thus career is largely directed behind the scenes by Terry Stricter the head of a new age religion called MindHead. Bobby comes up with a scheme that he believes will get around Kit not agreeing to star: film Kit without him knowing that he is being filmed. The only person who knows of the scheme is Dave Bobby's lowest of low level inside man turned cinematographer who has unofficial (i.e. technically stolen and thus free) access to studio camera equipment and general knowledge of Kit's general day-to-day movements through the studio system. Bobby is able to convince all the other actors that Kit's acting process involves he not interacting with them outside of filming the specific scenes he has with them. Part of Bobby's scheme involves using Kit's general paranoia that aliens truly are invading the planet to get his gut reactions to what is happening within the context of the script. But Bobby knows he has to get Kit to scream the closing lines of the movie "gotcha suckas" for the movie to be a success. Complications ensue when another of the the actors Carol tries to go against Bobby's policy of not making contact with Kit outside of filming and when Bobby is required to hire a production assistant cum stunt double cum acting double whose job in part is to stand-in for the requisite Kit Ramsey naked ass shot. Through it all Bobby will know if he has made it in Hollywood if he gets a specific sign specifically from the heavens in the form of FedEx.

One of the surprises was an all-woman cast novel in the 1930's. And although there were no men in the cast most of the dialog was about them. The story is rather thin and depended on the fact that divorce in the 1930's was not only difficult but almost impossible in New York. Mrs. Stephen Haynes learns that her husband is seeing a salesgirl at Saks and reluctantly divorces him abetted by her friends all of whom have romantic problems of their own. In the 1930's New York women who could afford it went to Nevada where residency could be established quickly and divorce was relatively easy. The 1939 film starring Norma Shearer Paulette Goddard Rosalind Russell and Joan Crawford was a hit. This one with an even better looking cast is definitely not largely because someone tried to move a 1930's situation comedy into the present.

Despite enjoying his work photography (especially of the female form) and drumming Crane wanted to be a movie star. So it was with some reluctance that he accepted the title starring role in a new television sitcom called _"Hogan's Heroes" (1965)_ (qv) a WWII POW comedy. To his surprise the show became a hit and catapulted him to television stardom. The fame resulting from the show led to excesses and a meeting with home video salesman and technician John Carpenter with who he would form a friendship based on their mutual interests namely excessive sex (for Crane purely heterosexual sex) and capturing nude females on celluloid. His fame allowed Crane to have as much sex as he wanted which was incongruent to his somewhat wholesome television friendly image and the way he portrayed himself to almost everyone except Carpenter and his extramarital sex partners. His sex addiction was somewhat known but ignored by his high school sweetheart/first wife Anne Crane née Terzian but well known by his second wife Patti Olson better known as 'Sigrid Valdis' (qv) his Hogan's Heroes co-star. Especially after the end of Hogan's Heroes in 1971 this incongruence and his friendship with Carpenter with who he would have a continuing love/hate relationship would contribute to both his professional and personal downfall.

They encounter the ghost of a dead librarian but are frightened away when she transforms into a horrifying monster. After losing their jobs at Columbia University the trio establish a paranormal investigation and elimination service known as "Ghostbusters". They develop high-tech equipment capable of capturing ghosts and open their business in a disused run-down firehouse. Egon warns them never to cross the energy streams of their proton pack weapons as this could cause a catastrophic explosion. They capture their first ghost Slimer at a hotel and deposit it in a specially built containment unit in the firehouse basement. As paranormal activity increases in New York City they hire a fourth member Winston Zeddemore to cope with demand. The Ghostbusters are retained by cellist Dana Barrett whose apartment is haunted by a demonic spirit Zuul a demigod worshiped as a servant to Gozer the Gozerian a Sumerian shape-shifting god of destruction. Venkman takes a particular interest in the case and competes with Dana's neighbor accountant Louis Tully for her affections. As the Ghostbusters investigate Dana is demonically possessed by Zuul which declares itself the "Gatekeeper" and Louis by a similar demon Vinz Clortho the "Keymaster". Both demons speak of the coming of the destructive Gozer and the release of the imprisoned ghosts and the Ghostbusters take steps to keep the two apart. Walter Peck (William Atherton) a lawyer representing the Environmental Protection Agency has the Ghostbusters arrested for operating unlicensed waste handlers and orders their ghost containment system deactivated causing an explosion that releases hundreds of ghosts. The ghosts wreak havoc throughout the city while Louis/Vinz advances toward Dana/Zuul's apartment. Their romantic encounter opens the gate and transforms them into supernatural hounds. Consulting blueprints of Dana's apartment building the Ghostbusters learn that mad doctor and cult leader Ivo Shandor claiming humanity was too sick to survive after World War I designed the building as a gateway to summon Gozer and bring about the end of the world. The Ghostbusters are released from custody to combat the supernatural crisis but after reaching the roof of Dana's building they are unable to prevent the arrival of Gozer who initially appears in the form of a woman. Seemingly subdued by the team's proton packs Gozer disappears. Moments later however her voice echoes that "the Traveller has come" and demands the team choose a form for the "Destructor". Ray inadvertently recalls a beloved corporate mascot from his childhood  "something that could never ever possibly destroy us". Gozer the Destructor arrives in the form of a giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man and proceeds to attack the city. The Ghostbusters cross their proton pack energy streams (reversing the particle flow) and fire them against Gozer's portal; the explosion defeats the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man and frees Dana and Louis. As thousands of New Yorkers wipe themselves free of marshmallow the Ghostbusters are welcomed on the street as heroes.

To survive he is reading the obituaries and trying to convince the widows that the deceased purchased a painting shortly before dying. Things take an ugly turn when Art is trying this scam with mobster Gene (Danny Aiello) whose father just died. Not only does Gene not fall for it but he tries to have his henchmen beat Art up. Art barely escapes by hiding in the Rolls Royce of Betty Kerner (Melanie Griffith) Gene's estranged two-time ex-wife and wealthy heiress. Betty is excited about helping the handsome stranger and the two end up shortly thereafter making love. Betty being very impulsive she wants to marry Art in two weeks. Because of the heiress fortune the news immediately makes the tabloids. Stuck between Betty who won't change her mind and Gene who still loves his ex-wife Art doesn't like the idea of getting married with such short notice but decides to play along for now. One morning at Betty's mansion Art seductively enters her shower naked only to realize it's not Betty who's in there but her sister Liz (Daryl Hannah) an art professor. If Art is attracted to Liz she stays very cold and distant seeing him as nothing more than a gigolo who hit the jackpot. Art decides to invent a fake twin brother Bart (who wears glasses and has his hair down instead of wearing a ponytail) who is allegedly a painter who just got back from Italy. Bart and Liz instantly hit it off while Gene still tries to romance Betty. Bart and Liz can't stop talking about everything he plays with her dog and even invites her to Manny's studio when he's not in pretending to show her his art. When Liz's favorite painting in the studio turns out to have been actually made by Art (who gave it to Manny as an "advance" on what he owes him) Bart gives her the painting. Thanks to his imaginary twin brother Art manages to pursue a romance with both sisters. Because the two "twin brothers" must never be in the same place at the same time it however involves a lot of running around coming up with a lot of excuses and enlisting a very reluctant Gloria's help. One evening he needs to go out two separate dates with both Betty and Liz. At the restaurant with Betty he decides to drug her wine much to the horror of the sommelier (Vincent Schiavelli). This allows him to cut the date short and put a very sleepy Betty to bed. He then goes out with Liz (who chooses the very same restaurant) and ends up making love to her. The next morning Art/Bart has to run back and forth between the two sister's bedrooms (whose two bathrooms share a private swimming pool) as he's supposed to be with them both at the same time. In the evening before the wedding Art spots Gene's two henchmen around his house and manages to escape them thanks to his dad's help (Eli Wallach). He tries to spend the night at Gloria's but he discovers she started dating Manny. Manny however gives him the keys to his studio where he can spend the night. At the studio Art starts to paint again when he is interrupted by Gene's henchmen who found him and start beating him up before Gene shows up. When Art proposes Gene to leave town Gene tells him to go ahead with the wedding and threatens to break one bone for each tear Betty cries. After they leave Liz arrives to the studio thinking Bart got beat up. When Bart tells her he is Art that he fell in love when he saw her in the shower and tries to kiss her Liz thinks Art is trying to make a pass at her not realizing Bart doesn't exist. On the wedding day Liz tells Bart his "brother" tried to kiss her and that the wedding should be called off. Bart needs to "confront" Art in a study alone with Liz and Gene listening outside -and unbeknownst to anyone also by Betty through the phone. When Gene enters the study he confronts a lonely Art and again threatens him if he doesn't marry Betty. He tells him that what Art or even himself want is irrelevant and that the only thing that matters is Betty's happiness. During the wedding ceremony Betty shaken by Gene's selfless devotion calls the wedding off and falls in Gene's arms acknowledging she still love him too. Gene and Betty elope. In the general confusion Liz sees her dog wanting to play with Art and realizes Art and Bart are the same person. Bart then go see Liz telling her a fake excuse to "go back to Italy" (which she of course doesn't buy) adding he's not worthy of her. A few month later Art's gallery has experienced a dramatic turnaround (Gloria owns and manages it and Art is the artist) and is now very successful. At the inauguration of his work Art notices Liz who still has feeling for him but is not sure who he is really. Art manages to convince her he is the one she had feelings for and the movie ends with the two happily walking in the street hand in hand.

He has requested that his cremated ashes be bored into a specific curling stone he has just had retrieved from the bottom of Long Bay. His will also has a non-binding codicil to reunite the last team he coached to curl in the Golden Broom Bonspiel in town a Long Bay team which has never won and that team which was the closest ever to doing so. Donald wants that specific stone in which he is buried to be delivered as the final shot to sit on the button for the win for the Long Bay team. Beyond the four team members not having curled at all since their last bonspiel ten years ago they each have issues in their lives which may make coming together as a team and winning and curling in its entirety difficult or a non-priority. Lead Neil Bucyk's life is directed by his controlling wife Linda a right she believes she has as his livelihood is in her family's business a funeral home. Second Eddie Strombeck and his wife Lilly are trying to conceive her ovulation cycles which may trump all else in his life especially as they have long tried to have a baby without success (although they are having a good time in the trying). Third James Lennox who has recently returned to town with Joanne the latest in a long line of not too bright casual and short term girlfriends is a drug dealer whose biggest priority may be to evade the thugs to who he owes a lot of money. But the biggest question mark may be skip Chris Cutter who unilaterally made the decision to break up the team when he left town to work in the Alberta oil patch. He quit curling over guilt in not reporting a burnt rock in that last bonspiel that rock which he ultimately threw into Long Bay (i.e. the rock in which Donald is now buried). The issue of skill may be somewhat addressed if Chris is willing to reconnect with his father and Donald's friend Gordon Cutter with who Chris has been estranged over family issues but who remains the most knowledgeable curler in town. The other part of the skill issue is that the Butte team will be curling in the bonspiel their entire team but especially skip Alexander Yount who are treated like rock stars in the curling world. If Chris remains in town to curl he also has to address some personal issues as his departure ten years ago broke up his relationship with Donald's daughter Julie Foley that adversity which in part led to she coming out ahead professionally as a member now of the space program. However Donald's other daughter single mother physiotherapist and admitted alcoholic Amy Foley who was Chris' drinking buddy and is everyone's best friend has always had feelings for Chris herself something of which Chris and Julie deep in their hearts are aware.

Her son Aaron suffers from Usher syndrome that is slowly destroying his sight and hearing. With the help of Dr. Barker (Paul Giamatti) Robin is barely able to stave off the worst effects of her son's decline. Robin agrees to sell the film rights to her digital image to Miramount Studios (a portmanteau of Miramax and Paramount) in exchange for a hefty sum of money and the promise to never act again. After her body is digitally scanned the studio will be able to make films starring her using only computer-generated characters. Twenty years later as her contract is about to expire Robin travels to Abrahama City where she will speak at Miramount's "Futurological Congress" and also renew her contract. By then Robin's digital likeness has become the star of a popular science-fiction film franchise "Rebel Robot Robin". Abrahama City is an animated zone where individuals use chemicals to become animated avatars of themselves entering a mutable illusory state they can become anything they want to be. While discussing the new contract with Miramount Robin learns that the studio has developed a new technology that will allow anyone to transform themselves into her. Robin agrees to the deal but has a crisis of conscience and does not believe she or anyone else should be turned into a product. Asked to speak at the Congress Robin publicly voices her views enraging the hosts of the Congress. Shortly afterwards the Congress is attacked by rebels ideologically opposed to the technology. During the attack Robin is protected by Dylan Truliner (Jon Hamm) but is soon captured by "Miramount Police". Still in the animated world Robin is executed; without coming out of the animated world Robin is shown on a hospital bed while doctors also animated discuss her case. One of the doctors reveals that when Robin was found she pleaded with her rescuers to execute her. The doctors decide that Robin is so ill that she must be frozen until a time when a treatment for her mental illness is found. Many years later still animated Robin is revived and reunites with Dylan who guides Robin to a new animated world in which anything is possible and the ego no longer exists. Dylan reveals that he had once been Miramount's lead animator and had used her digital likeness to make movies for Miramount. The two fall in love but Robin is still desperate to return to the real world and be with her son. The only way to do that is using a capsule that Dylan was given by Miramount his reward for twenty years of service. The capsule is only powerful enough for one person and Dylan has no more. Dylan gives it to Robin begging her not to look at the real him when she returns to the real world. Re-entering the un-animated real world Robin finds it in extreme disrepair and the inhabitants severely dysfunctional. Those who are still able to cope in the real world hover over its ruined cities in large airships. On one of the ships Robin finds Doctor Barker who reveals the state of the world in which most people have changed to an existence in an animated unreal world. Hoping to find Aaron Robin's hopes are dashed when Barker reveals that Aaron "crossed over" into the animated world only six months earlier when his condition had left him virtually blind and deaf. Because Aaron likely created a new identity for himself in the animated world there is no way for anyone to find him. While Robin can return to an animated existence she cannot return to the one she left behind including Dylan because that world was not real but created by her consciousness. Dr. Barker gives Robin an inhalation ampule that will allow her to return to the animated world. Taking it Robin experiences memories of her son's life being born seeing his mother for the first time as an infant watching his mother act as an older child being taken to Dr. Barker as a young adult watching his mother leave for The Congress finding his mother in suspended animation and finally taking the capsule that will take him away from the real world forever. The story ends with an animated Robin having the same appearance as Aaron discovering Aaron in the middle of an animated desert; it is left for the viewer to decide if the reunion is real or a dream.

They spend much of their time at their local Knapely Yorkshire County chapter of the Women's Institute (WI) whose motto is "enlightenment fun and friendship". Although they like most of the women at the WI (the friendship part) they but the perceived flaky Chris in particular hold the way Marie the local president runs the chapter with derision. They find much of what goes on there especially the monthly presentations banal and devoid of enlightenment and fun. Equally as banal was last year's fund-raising calendar featuring local bridges which raised a meager £75.60 with this year's proposed calendar local churches promising to be even more so. After Annie's husband John passes away from leukemia Chris wants the WI to provide a memorial in his memory: a new sofa for the family room at the hospital. The one Chris wants to buy costs £999 which she proposes to raise by changing the fund-raising calendar to one featuring tasteful photographs of nude Knapely WI members. She got the idea by seeing all around her the notion of the old adage that sex sells. Annie likes the idea as it is analogous to one of horticultural-loving John's last statements about plants being the most glorious in the latter stages of their life after which they quickly go to seed. To get the project off the ground they not only have to convince nine other WI members to pose (December to be a group photograph) but they have to find a photographer they trust that will treat this task as an art project. Conversely they aren't sure if they and the calendar will meet with the same contempt from Marie the national WI organization and their friends and family that they are so trying to change in the Knapely WI and in the process not only not raise the necessary money but in fact lose money instead. Publicity for the project in any form may have its own consequences especially for Chris.

Much to the dismay of his mother Rose (Emily Watson) his father Ted buys the colt at auction outbidding their landlord Lyons despite their needing a more suitable plough horse for the farm work. Albert's best friend Andrew Easton watches as Albert teaches his colt many things such as to come when he imitates the call of an owl by blowing through his cupped hands. He names the horse Joey. Ted carries a war injury that causes him ongoing physical and mental pain. While he cannot speak of his time in the Cavalry Rose shows Albert his father's medals from the Second Boer War that he earned for bravery under fire. She gives Albert his father's regimental pennant telling Albert that his father felt shame over what he did during the war and that he had thrown the flag and medals away though Rose saved and kept them hidden. Albert does not understand why Ted would be ashamed of having fought in a war. Against all odds and Lyons' hopes Albert manages to train Joey and have him plough a rocky field that Ted plants with turnips. However a heavy downpour in 1914 destroys the turnip crop so Ted is compelled to sell the horse to the army in order to pay his rent. Albert begs his father to return the money. Captain James Nicholls sees the boy's attachment and promises to look after the steed. Albert tries to enlist in the army but is too young and before the captain leaves with Joey Albert ties his father's pennant to Joey's bridle. Joey is trained for military operations and becomes attached to Topthorn a black horse with whom he is trained for his military role. The two horses are deployed to Flanders with a flying column under the command of Nicholls and Major Jamie Stewart but they lead a cavalry charge through a German encampment and the unit is mown down by machine gun fire. Nicholls is killed along with almost all his fellow cavalrymen; the Germans capture the horses. A young German soldier called Gunther is assigned to the care of Joey and Topthorn who are used to draw an ambulance wagon. When his 14-year-old brother Michael is sent to the front line Gunther takes the horses and the four of them desert hiding inside a nearby farm. However the boys are soon discovered and executed by firing squad. An orphaned French girl named Emilie who lives at the farm with her grandfather finds the two horses and takes care of them. German soldiers arrive and confiscate supplies from the property even the jam that Emilie's grandfather makes but Emilie hides the horses in her bedroom. Emilie suffers from a disease that makes her bones fragile and is not allowed to ride the horses for fear of falling. Nonetheless Emilie's Grandfather for her birthday allows her to ride Joey. She gallops the horse up the hill and runs into the Germans who then take the horses breaking Emilie's heart. The grandfather keeps the pennant. By 1918 Albert has enlisted and is fighting alongside Andrew in the Second Battle of the Somme under the command of Lyons's son David. After a British charge into no-man's land Albert and Andrew miraculously make it across into a deserted German trench where a gas bomb explodes filling the trench with poison gas. Joey and Topthorn are used by the Germans to haul artillery up a large muddy hill under the command of Private Friedrich Henglemann who tries to keep the horses alive. Topthorn eventually succumbs to exhaustion and dies. Friedrich is dragged away by other German soldiers leaving Joey to face an oncoming Mark IV tank. The horse escapes and runs into no-man's land where he gets entangled in the barbed wire barriers. From their respective trenches both British and German soldiers spot Joey in the night mist and a British soldier named Colin waves a white flag and tries to free the horse. Peter (Hinnerk Schonemann) a German soldier comes over with wire cutters and together they free Joey from the wire. The two make friendly talk on the remorseless war. They flip a coin to decide who should take the horse; Colin wins and guides Joey back to the British trench now having made friends with Peter. Andrew is killed by the gas attack but Albert survives temporarily blinded. While recuperating he hears about the "miraculous horse" rescued from no-man's land. The army doctor instructs Sgt. Fry to put Joey down. But when Fry is about to shoot Joey hears the owl call he learnt as a colt. Albert is led through the troops to Joey again sounding his call and Joey hurries to meet his long-missed friend. Albert explains that he raised Joey and with bandages still covering his eyes gives an exact description of the horse's markings confirming his claim. With Joey covered in mud the camp doctor at first dismisses Albert's statement but he is astonished when soldiers wash away the grime revealing the four white socks and diamond star on Joey's forehead. An order is made that the horse should be auctioned and Albert is given money collected from his fellow soldiers in order to bid for him but bidding by a butcher exceeds that of the collection. Then a bid of 100 is entered. The bidder is an older gentleman Emilie's grandfather who informs the butcher that if he is bid against he will sell his coat and bid to 110  and should he bid against him again he will sell his farm and bid to 1000. No other bid is placed and the grandfather takes ownership of Joey planning to return with him to his farm. He tells Albert that Emilie has died and after hearing about the miracle horse he travelled for three days to get Joey back for the sake of his beloved granddaughter's memory. Albert pleads for the horse with Emilie's grandfather who at first remains unmoved. The old man is surprised however when the horse chooses to return to Albert and he presents Albert with the military pennant asking him what it is. Albert's quick recognition of the pennant convinces the grandfather that Joey is indeed his horse. He gives Joey back to Albert saying that it's what Emilie would have wanted. Albert returns with Joey to his family's farm where he returns the pennant to his father. The elder Narracott extends his hand to the boy now a man and like him a former soldier.

Simmons	810	M	Keri Russell	885	F	Dakota Goyo	3479	M	Alyvia Alyn Lind	6110	F	Josh Hamilton	6573	M	Josh Stamberg	8713	M	In a suburban street the Barrett Family consisting of mother Lacy (Keri Russell) father Daniel (Josh Hamilton) older son Jesse (Dakota Goyo) and younger son Sammy (Kadan Rockett) hosts a barbecue and invites their friends the Jessops. At night Jesse and Sammy communicate with each other from their beds via walkie-talkie. Jesse is reading scary stories about The Sandman which frightens Sammy. Lacy wakes up at night and checks on her boys before heading down to the kitchen where she discovers the refrigerator door open with its contents spread out all over the floor. The backdoor is also wide open. The next day she and Daniel believe an animal broke in although Lacy questions why the vegetables were eaten while the meat remained untouched. Daniel has a job interview which doesn't go well; and he receives a notice in the mail that their mortgage payment is late. In the middle of the night Lacy wakes up and heads down to the kitchen. She discovers all of their canned and packaged foods stacked up in towers all over the kitchen counters floor and table. The chandelier over the dining table appears to project a strange sign on the ceiling. She brushes it off as a nightmare. In the morning the police come to see if there was a break in but they find nothing. The police officer suggests Daniel reconnect his home security system despite the cost. The next night the alarm is set off waking up the family. Daniel shuts it off and notices that all doors and windows are still locked. The alarm company calls and says was a malfunction in the system because it shows that all entry points were breached at the same time. Lacy and Daniel then notice all of their photographs have disappeared from their frames. The alarm company sends over a technician in the morning who determines that nothing was breached. The strange events increase in frequency and escalate in danger. While Sammy is playing soccer with the other kids he wets himself stares into space and screams. Lacy who is at home witnesses hundreds of birds crashing into the house. At night Lacy is awakened by a sound and hears Sammy talking. When she goes to check on him she sees an alien figure standing over his bed. She screams and turns on the light only to find an empty room. Daniel and Lacy run from room to room looking for Sammy when Daniel sees him in the front yard walking away from the house. They retrieve him but Sammy has no idea why he is outside. Immediately after this experience Daniel installs security cameras around the house. The next day Lacy has a viewing at a house for sale. As she's pitching the house to a couple she becomes unable to speak and enters a trance. She walks towards the glass door and begins to bash her head repeatedly against it before waking up in her own bed. She finds a bruise forming on her forehead and notices that she blacked out for six hours. The scientist investigating the birds flying into her home calls Lacy and tells her the birds came from three different flocks migrating from three different directions and it was as if something was "drawing" the birds to her home. Lacy begins to search online for answers and finds articles on UFOs along with pictures other children have drawn that are very similar the ones Sammy has drawn of a child and three grey figures holding hands beside a house. That night Lacy wakes up around midnight and finds Daniel standing in the backyard in a catatonic state his mouth agape in apparent terror. His nose begins to bleed heavily. He wakes up with no memory of what happened. Lacy and Daniel watch the video camera footage of Daniel getting out of bed and walking outside and Lacy tells him about the things she read about UFOs though Daniel dismisses her. Sammy goes to the pool with the Jessops the next day but refuses to go swimming. Shelly (Annie Thurman) attempts to take off his shirt and discovers a strange formation of bruises all over his chest. Jesse and his friend Kevin Ratner (L. J. Benet) sneak into the woods behind a golf course where Kevin shoots at Jesse with a pellet gun. Jesse freezes in a standing position and has a seizure that causes his eyes to roll back into his head. He is taken to the hospital where the doctors inform Lacy and Daniel that Jesse is covered in strange symbols that had to have been branded onto his body. Because of Jesse's age the doctor informs Lacy and Daniel that he must notify Child Protective Services. When Daniel hears that Ratner and Jesse were together just prior to the incident he believes that Ratner is the one who hurt Jesse; he attacks Ratner in his front yard before being knocked out by Ratner's dad drawing the ire of Jesse. Jesse returns from the hospital and the Jessops now also believe that the Barretts are abusing their children. That night Daniel is watching upstairs and finds Sammy sleeping; and when he attempts to wake him Sammy sits up and has black holes where his eyes should be. Daniel awakes from this dream in a sweat and then returns to look at the footage of the camera going frame by frame until in one frame distorted by static he sees three dark figures standing over the beds of everyone in the family. He now believes Lacy's claim that there is an extraterrestrial force at work. They seek the help of a specialist Edwin Pollard (J. K. Simmons) who calls the beings "The Grays". Pollard informs them that many others have suffered the same fate as the Barretts with most cases ending in a child abduction. Edwin states that among other things sickness and nosebleeds are signs that a family is experiencing Gray activity as is the drawing that Lacy discovered. Lacy finds a wall in Edwin's apartment covered in newspaper articles about missing children. Edwin warns the Barretts that the person who the Grays first show interest in is usually the one who is abducted and that they should be hyper-protective of Sammy whom he believes has been "chosen". He states that their only hope is work together to save Sammy in hopes the aliens will move on to another family. Daniel goes out and buys a shotgun while Lacy buys an aggressive guard dog. The family spend July 4th boarding up the windows of the house then eat dinner and recount earlier July 4ths for the boys. While watching fireworks on the TV the transmission is cut to static all the lights begin to flicker and the dog starts barking ferociously at the boarded up front door. Lacy sends Jesse into his room with Sammy and tells him not to take his eyes off of his brother. She stands guard outside the door with a knife in hand. Downstairs Daniel has his gun pointed at the front door as bright lights shine around it. The screws holding the boards in place unscrew on their own and all the power in the house cuts out. Upstairs Lacy hears the TV in her bedroom turn on. She walks towards it unaware of a Gray standing directly behind her and becomes trapped in her room. Daniel fires into the bright light hoping to hit one of the Grays. He then runs upstairs and gets Jesse and Sammy into his and Lacy's room where they barricade themselves in and huddle together on the bed. The TV begins to flicker again and the Grays can be seen in the room surrounding the bed. Lacy sees them and screams and Jesse blacks out. Jesse awakes in the foreclosed house from earlier in the film. He finds his mother dead in the bloodied kitchen before witnessing his father commit suicide. Seeing his brother he chases after Sammy before reawakening in the upstairs hallway of his house. Daniel Lacy and Sammy are all together staring at Jesse in concern and bewilderment. The Grays appear in front of Jesse there is flash of light and he is abducted. Three months later Lacy and Daniel are suspects in Jesse's disappearance and they've moved into an apartment. Pollard cuts out a newspaper article about Jesse's disappearance and hangs it on his wall with all the other pictures of missing children.

The title is a reference to Little Boy the code name for the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima as well as a reference to Pepper's height. Pepper has an extremely close relationship with his loving father. It begins from the very moment he is born when his father cradles him in his arms and mentions how small he is. When Pepper is examined by a doctor the physician is asked if the child is a midget. However the doctor says that the term is offensive and suggests that he is just a "little boy." The term "little boy" had become Pepper's nickname. He would learn to despise those two words and always make a problem when someone would call out his nickname. However when World War II begins Pepper's older brother is declared ineligible for military service because of flat feet and his father joins in his place. Not long after his father leaves for war Pepper hears the Bible verse "Truly I tell you if you have faith as small as a mustard seed you can say to this mountain Move from here to there and it will move" (Matthew 17:20) he becomes determined to get enough faith to bring his father home. Nevertheless as his friend and mentor Father Oliver tells him faith is useless to anyone who harbors hatred. The film highlights the tremendous hatred against Japanese-Americans that was rampant in America at this time. Father Oliver tells Pepper to befriend a Japanese man named Hashimoto. At first the anti-Japanese sentiment Pepper has internalized from society makes him hesitant to follow this advice but as he gets to know Hashimoto he begins to value their friendship and learns from Hashimoto to stand up to those who bully him about his height. Father Oliver gave Pepper a list of tasks to complete. The plot then takes a turn when Pepper's father is reported missing in action. Pepper's mother (Emily Watson) struggles to keep her family together in the face of these overwhelming hardships. His brother London and Sam one of the townspeople that lost a son go to Hashimoto's home and attack him one night leading to him being hospitalized. London is initially arrested but Hashimoto decides not to press charges and he is released. An Army representative brings the news that Pepper's father has been killed and is buried in the Philippines. Hashimoto goes to the memorial service at the O'hare Cemetery outside town to pay his respects. Pepper and Hashimoto sit on a bench and discuss their mutual losses of family and believing in something. Pepper goes back to the cemetery to visit his father's grave and place the list on top of his grave marker. Pepper and his mother go to the doctor where the town doctor Dr. Fox tries to hit on her and invite himself over to the house that evening under the pretext of talking about what could possibly be the cause of Pepper's short stature. Later that day a spokesperson from the Army arrives to tell her that her husband didn't die after all. The man that actually died had stolen Pepper's father's boots with his dog tags attached to the laces off his feet when he fell down after being shot so he was misidentified as Pepper's father James L. Busbee. The family goes to visit the father in the hospital and Pepper takes him the boots that he had been eyeing for some time which he bought for him after he went off to war. He holds the boots then hugs Pepper and touches the faces of the rest of his family. They all kneel around his chair and share a group hug.

Electrician and sometimes rodeo bull rider Ron Woodroof lives hard which includes heavy smoking drinking drug use (primarily cocaine) and casual sex. He is racist and homophobic. While in the hospital on a work related injury the doctors discover and inform him that he is HIV+ and that he will most-likely die within thirty days. Ron is initially in angry denial that he would have a disease that only "faggots" have but upon quick reflection comes to the realization that the diagnosis is probably true. He begins to read whatever research is available about the disease which at this time seems to be most effectively treated by the drug AZT. AZT however is only in the clinical trials stage within the US. Incredulous that he as a dying man cannot pay for any drug which may save or at least prolong his life he goes searching for it by whatever means possible. It eventually leads him to Mexico and a "Dr." Vass an American physician whose license was revoked in the US because of his AIDS related work against US regulations. Dr. Vass leads Ron to a cocktail of other drugs some vitamins he believes are more effective in treating the symptoms since the virus as Ron learns will always be in the system of those who have been exposed to it. Ron begins to smuggle these drugs not approved by the FDA into the US not only for his own use but for sale to other HIV+ persons. In this venture he goes into an unlikely partnership with a HIV+ transgender woman named Rayon who he met in the hospital and who has greater contact with AIDS patients through the gay community. As they try to work both above ground to get the meds to those that need them and underground to avoid detection by especially the FDA Ron comes up with an idea to circumvent the fact of selling the drugs - which are not considered drugs yet since they are not FDA approved - directly to the HIV+ population which then should should not be against the law. Richard Barkley and Dr. Sevard the FDA's lead man on the file and one of Ron's doctors respectively the latter who sees clinical trials as the only way to determine the efficacy of drugs despite the fact that Ron and others would have probably died already without these drugs try to stop Ron and Rayon at every turn. Caught in the middle is Dr. Eve Saks another of Ron's doctors who understands why policies are in place but who can sympathize with Ron Rayon and others - all her patients directly or indirectly - in their situation.

Renowned playwright 'J.M. Barrie' (qv) (James)'s latest effort has garnered less than positive reviews something he knew would be the case even before the play's mounting. This failure places pressure on James to write another play quickly as impresario Charles Frohman needs another to replace the failure to keep his theater viable. Out for a walk with his dog in part to let his creative juices flow James stumbles upon the Llewelyn Davies family: recently widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (the daughter of now deceased author 'George L. Du Maurier' (qv)) and her four adolescent sons. James and the family members become friends largely based on he and the boys being able to foster in each other the imagination of children James just being the biggest among them in this regard. Sylvia also welcomes James into their lives he who becomes an important and integral part of it. Among the six of them the only one who does not want to partake is Sylvia's third Peter Llewelyn Davies who is still grieving the reality of their lives where his father was there one day planning an outing for the family and gone the next. Two other people who don't appreciate James in the Llewelyn Davies' lives are: his wife Mary Barrie who always feels the need to be the responsible one in their relationship and who feels threatened by his friendship with an unmarried woman; and Emma du Maurier Sylvia's overbearing mother who sees him as an obstacle to Sylvia moving on with her life with another potential husband and an impediment to maintaining discipline within the boys. James still hopes to bring Peter out of his self-imposed shell but in the process comes up with an idea for another play based on an amalgam of himself and Peter that play which eventually becomes what Charles sees as a largely unmountable and thus doomed production called "Peter Pan". This process of helping Peter could take a step backward when it looks like Sylvia may imminently befall a similar fate to that of her late husband.

At the end of the debate Pastor Dan is invited to Blaylock's college for a nightcap. He brings along Carl. At Blaylock's office he reveals that he invited Pastor Dan over to propose that the two of them both bestselling authors collaborate on a book about their opposing worldviews and views on religion. During a discussion about morality without religion Pastor Dan picks up an antique pistol and pulls the trigger on Blaylock unaware that the gun is loaded and functional. The bullet hits Blaylock in the skull apparently killing him. In a state of shock Pastor Dan places the gun in Blaylock's hand to make it look like a suicide. He and Carl then drive home in silence neither of them telling anyone what happened. After getting a call from a stranger claiming to be his "friend" Pastor Dan approaches Carl's neighbor videographer Jerry Hobson and appears to confess to what happened. At the sermon the next day Pastor Dan informs the congregation that Blaylock survived his "suicide" the bullet was removed and he is in a coma.

Guzman who has a large business in construction plans to use the recording to blackmail Pastor Dan into giving him the contract to build City on a Hill promising to keep Carl in the house until the project is done. The next morning when Guzman revealed to be Pastor Day's mysterious "friend" leaves to make the deal Carl escapes the house which turns out to be in the same state as the church with a DVD containing the footage hidden in a bible. He calls Gwen asking her not to tell Pastor Dan and to call the police and later sees a news report revealing that Professor Blaylock has woken up and can tell the truth. Carl is picked up by a detective who turns out to be in liege with Pastor Dan and Jerry whom Gwen called instead.

In the words of Telly's husband Jim Paretta Telly has been holding onto the past like a "death grip" which has hindered her therapy. Telly does not appreciate that characterization as it makes it sound like Dr. Munce and Jim want her to forget Sam. Slowly incidents make it seem like Telly is losing that grip on the past until one day all physical evidence of Sam disappears personal as well as public such as all media stories of the plane disappearance. Subsequently Jim and Dr. Munce try to explain to her that her therapy is to help her get over the delusion that she and Jim have/had a son. As Telly alone goes on a search for any evidence of the existence of Sam the only person she is eventually able to convince is Ash Correll an ex-New York Ranger whose daughter Lauren allegedly was also one of the missing children. Ash who started to drink heavily fourteen months ago initially believed Telly to be crazy until he slowly recalls that he did indeed have a daughter named Lauren who disappeared in that plane which led to his drinking.

As Telly and Ash continue their search for evidence while eluding the NSA they believe that the answer may lie with the mysterious man who seems to have appeared lately in Telly's day-to-day goings-on.

Because Critical Jim is so fond of film noir and other classic films (such as Casablanca and Breakfast at Tiffany's) he's willing to listen to Finch as he tells his story imagining it as a film in progress. Finch obliges explaining how he got to be mistaken for Cletis Tout. Finch happened to be in the same jail with Micah (Richard Dreyfuss) who stole diamonds more than 20 years before then hid the diamonds and soon landed in prison. With Finch's help Micah manages to break out and the two get new identities for themselves courtesy of a coroner (Billy Connolly) who owes Finch a favor. The problem is that Finch's new identity is that of Cletis Tout a photojournalist who managed to get a mafia figure's son strangling a woman on film. The head of the mafia gets his men to kill Tout (which is how the coroner got the identity for Finch) but when Finch goes to Cletis' apartment to look for his passport a neighbor calls the police who inform the mafia head that Cletis Tout is still alive. After Micah meets up with his now grown-up daughter Tess (Portia de Rossi) he's accidentally shot by the men sent to kill Cletis. Just before dying Micah gets Finch to promise to watch after his daughter and thus Tess and Finch begin an uneasy relationship as they look for the diamonds. Meanwhile the mafia head decides to bring in a professional and subsequently calls in Critical Jim to finish the job. However Critical Jim is more interested in where Finch's story will end - specifically if he'll be able to reconcile with Tess in the end giving the story a perfect Hollywood ending.

Dr. Malcolm Sayer is hired as a clinical physician at a psychiatric hospital in the Bronx despite he only having a research background. The job is not ideal on his side as he has difficulties relating to people which is the reason he has focused on research projects not involving human subjects while the hospital hires him somewhat out of desperation in not finding anyone else with the qualifications who wants the job. Most of his patients are in a semi-catatonic state and are housed in what some of the orderlies coin the "garden" ward where all they can do for the patients is water and feed them. He notices that some of the patients despite their generally catatonic state respond in unusual ways to certain stimuli. In doing some research he also finds that some common bonds between these patients are that they suffered from encephalitis in the 1920s or 1930s and that their physical states are like they have Parkinson's disease frozen in time. As such he is able to convince albeit reluctantly his skeptical boss Dr. Kaufman to administer an expensive experimental drug therapy on only one patient with family consent. That patient is forty-one year old Leonard Lowe who has been in his current state since he was eleven years old and who has been supported by his loving mother through all these years. As the drug therapy "awakens" Leonard there are several issues that come into play. Malcolm has to try and convince Kaufman and the hospital administration to extend the therapy to the other patients. Despite not knowing the long term effects Leonard who was aware of his surroundings through his catatonic state may have mixed emotions about his situation wanting both to be treated as human being and an experiment guinea pig to ensure that what is happening benefits him and others in the long run. Mrs. Lowe may be unprepared for the new Leonard she expecting who she remembers as a sweet eleven year old boy. Through all these issues what may be the most illuminating issue for Malcolm is the need to stimulate the human spirit including his own in dealing with people around him.

Madea's Witness Protection (2012)	Tyler (I) Perry	4.8	7465	2012	Comedy	66899242	20000000	114	Tyler Perry	586	M	Charlie Sheen	995	M	John Amos	3392	M	Eugene Levy	4113	M	Tom Arnold	5351	M	Romeo Miller	8859	M	George Needleman a nerdy high level CFO in New York City promises his son that he will take him to his Saturday afternoon baseball game after he gets back from the office. He gets to his office and arrives to a harrowing scene; his co-workers are shredding documents and are in a state of chaos. He sees his boss Walter who informs him that his company is a Ponzi scheme run by the mob. He is being accused of spearheading the scheme and laundering funds and has to enter his family into a witness protection program. The program relocates them to a refuge where no one will think to look for them: Madea and Joe's house in Georgia. Meanwhile Jake - whose elderly ailing father is a church pastor who has put him in charge of the church's mortgage fund - stages a robbery (which is unsuccessful). Jake who has a criminal past but whose father trusts that he has turned over a new leaf is trying to recover church funds that he has invested in Needleman's company without his father's knowledge or consent only to lose the entire investment in the Ponzi scheme. The Needlemans' first meeting with Madea and Joe is awkward and bodes poorly for how everyone will get along. However over time Madea helps Kate and Cindy relate better to each other and to other family members while Joe and Kate help George become more confident more in touch with his surroundings and people around him and more effective in channeling his emotions. Barbara displays dual sensibilities about "colored people". On one hand she mistakes Madea for a domestic named Sadie treats "Sadie" imperiously and threatens to get her fired. On the other hand she recognizes Joe as a man she slept with years ago (and George's biological father) and relates to him seductively; she also enjoys Negro spirituals and repeatedly asks to be taken to the African American church down the street from Madea's house. Pastor Nelson's sermon inspires George to recognize a pattern in his company's records that explains where 10% of the stolen funds have been stashed. After church watching Whoopi Goldberg's Oda Mae Brown character in Ghost inspires George to involve Madea in a plan to redivert funds from the "stashed" accounts back to the charities whose investments were stolen in the Ponzi scheme. The plan requires George (who disguises himself as a Frenchman to avoid detection by the Malone mob "family") Jake and Madea (who assumes the identity of an upscale woman named Precious Jackson) to travel to New York City and for "Precious" to meet with a bank manager to transfer funds from the laundered accounts to the legitimate charities. Madea successfully accomplishes her mission although she improvises both an expansion of her assumed identity (by pretending to be the oldest Jackson sister) and of the accounts to which "Precious's" funds are transferred by having some money sent to her real bank account unbeknownst to George and Jake. When George and Jake begin to share their plan with Brian (Perry) he cuts them off and advises them it's illegal. However after they pull off the caper Brian informs George that his cooperation with the authorities and his successful efforts to return the charities' funds have given Brian leverage to dismiss the charges against George. Kate points out to George that the situation has strengthened their relationship and their family and that it is a blessing in disguise. Upon leaving Madea's house Cindy and Howie ask if they can come back to visit but both Madea and Joe immediately decline (though Madea does so in a sweet demeanor). Before returning to New York the Needlemans visit Pastor Nelson's church one last time. The Pastor and Jake burn the mortgage papers and the entire congregation celebrates the mortgage's being paid off and the Needlemans enjoy the Negro spirituals. Madea also enjoys the spiritual music from her front porch celebrating her new wealth.

The group returns once again to Hilton's house with Sam's boyfriend Rob who also steals from the home. A news report releases captured CCTV footage from the robbery at Patridge's home. This concerns Marc but Rebecca is undeterred and instigates a burglary at the home of Rachel Bilson. Word spreads amongst the group's social circles and the girls boast of their accomplishments at parties also posting photographs of the stolen items on social media sites. The group ultimately breaks into Lohan's house and robs it. Shortly after Rebecca moves to Las Vegas with her father due to troubles at home leaving some of her stolen items with Marc who inadvertently helps Rebecca transfer stolen items across state lines. News reports of the Hollywood Hills burglaries intensify with the media labeling the group "The Bling Ring". CCTV from several robberies in addition to the evidence on social media allows authorities to identify the group. Police arrest Marc Nicki Chloe Rebecca Rob and Ricky but Sam is not identified in the footage and avoids arrest. Marc cooperates with the police informing them on the details of the burglaries much to the chagrin of Rebecca who has been identified as the ringleader. A Vanity Fair journalist interviews Marc who is remorseful and Nicki who vehemently suggests the others were at fault and that she was simply involved with the wrong people. Rebecca also denies being at fault and tries to pass the blame for all of this to Marc and her other friends. The group is ultimately prosecuted receiving varying amounts of jail time and is ordered to collectively pay millions of dollars in restitution for the stolen items. The group serves their jail time and Marc and Rebecca each go into seclusion from the press. They never see or speak to each other again and both of them steadfastly blame each other for the robberies. In the final scene set a few months later Nicki is on a talk show talking about her time in jail and reveals that her cell was next to Lohan's. After digressing she turns to the audience (and the viewers) as she finds a way to enhance her newfound notoriety telling them to visit her now-popular website detailing her life after "The Bling Ring".

Professional jock and former professional baseball player Champ Kind handles the sports the curiously dim witted Brick Tamland - who's a few channels short of a cable subscription - handles the weather and ladies' man Brian Fantana - whose collection of fine scents would be in the Guinness Book Of Records - handles the on-field reporting. But now all that is about to change forever. The TV station Burgundy works for Channel 4 has embraced diversity and has hired a beautiful new female anchor named Veronica Corningstone. While Ron Burgundy and the rest of the Channel 4 news team enjoys fighting with competitors drinking and flirting with the ladies Veronica quietly climbs her way to the top.

Now left with nothing Ron must find a way to get back to the top - and that involves a story about a rare Chinese panda giving birth on US soil. Will Ron be the one to report the story on a national level?

When she attempts to go find some lost things Vidia asks her if she's going to the human house which isn't far from camp. The question makes Tink curious and eventually sneaks off. Vidia follows behind to watch over her. When she reaches the house she is amazed by their "horseless carriage". She takes the time to flitter around under the car while Vidia tries to get her to leave. Eventually they do but on their way back to camp Tink and Vidia stumble upon a fairy-sized house made by Lizzy a human girl who wishes to meet a real fairy. Tink immediately heads in to investigate despite Vidia's constant warnings. Tink claims it to be perfectly safe so Vidia slams the door shut in an attempt to scare her but unintentionally locks Tink inside. When Lizzy begins to approach the house Vidia tries to free Tink to no avail. Lizzy discovers Tink inside and takes her to her home. She prepares to show Tink to her father Dr. Griffiths a very busy and serious scientist but upon seeing all the butterflies he has pinned in display for research she decides to keep Tink a secret. Meanwhile Vidia rallies Rosetta Iridessa Fawn Silvermist Clank and Bobble to rescue Tink. They try to sail on a stream which would take them straight to the Griffiths' house. When their ship goes over a waterfall Silvermist manipulates the water to create a mid-air stream. While this does save their lives the boat is wrecked. They continue on foot but upon crossing a mudbank Vidia gets stuck waist deep. While Clank and Bobble try to find something to pull her out the other fairies are nearly run over by a car but are saved when Iridessa blinds the driver who then vacates the car giving the girls a chance to get Vidia out by grabbing onto the driver's shoelace. Back at the human house Lizzy reveals her fascination of fairies. Tink is flattered by her obsession and since Tink can't leave the house because it's raining outside she decides to teach her nearly everything about fairies. They record their information in a new research book given to Lizzy by her father. During this time they have grown a great friendship. After a while the rain dies down and Tink is able to return to camp. She gives Lizzy a hug and makes her way out but before she leaves she watches Lizzy attempt to show her father the research. Unfortunately Dr. Griffiths is too busy fixing the house's leaks to pay her any mind so Tink returns and fixes the leaks saving Lizzy's father from the burden. Afterwards she makes the choice to release a captive butterfly Dr. Griffiths was planning on showing to a group of scientists. Thinking that his daughter was the one who set free the butterfly free he sends her to her room. Meanwhile Vidia confesses to the rescue team that it was her fault that Tink has been captured. They comfort Vidia about the situation informing her that it could have been worse without her presence. Once the rescue team finally reaches the human house they are attacked by Lizzy's pet cat Mr. Twitches. Despite being an animal fairy Fawn is unable to immediately tame a cat under pressure. A chase ensues before she is able to find catnip eventually taming the cat. Back at the house Tink shows Lizzy how to fly in her room with pixie dust. Then her father walks in forcing Tink to hide in the fairy house. He finds footprints on the ceiling and sternly demands the truth. Lizzy tells him about Tink and shows him the research she and the fairy did in the book he gave her. Her father however still refuses to believe in fairies and he and his daughter get into a disagreement. Angered by Dr. Griffiths stubbornness Tink reveals herself and chides him. The sight of the fairy astonishes the scientist and prompts him to capture Tink so that he could take her to London for research but Vidia arrives just in time and pushes her out the way. Vidia is instead captured by Dr. Griffiths but Lizzy and the fairies are able to convince him to think otherwise. In the end Dr. Griffiths apologizes to his daughter for not believing her. Vidia is then freed and she and Tink form a friendship. Lizzy and her father are now closer than ever.

The United States government provides him a laboratory located in Ithaca New York masked as a medical company. Mathewson moves to Ithaca and meets real estate agent Elizabeth Stephens (Jill Eikenberry) while searching for an apartment. He attempts to win the affections of the single mother by inviting her teenage son Paul (Christopher Collet) to take a tour of the lab. Mathewson is confident in the lab's cover story but Paul an unusually gifted student with a passion for science becomes suspicious when he discovers a statistically impossible patch of five-leaf clover on the grounds. Paul and his aspiring journalist girlfriend Jenny Anderman (Cynthia Nixon) decide to expose the weapons factory in dramatic fashion. Paul breaks into the lab and steals a container of plutonium. To obtain maximum publicity Paul decides to build an atomic bomb and enter it into the New York Science Fair. After convincing his mother and his school that his project is about hamsters bred in darkness he begins research and construction of the nuclear device. The lab discovers that a container of plutonium has been replaced by a bottle of shampoo mixed with glitter. A military investigation team led by Lt. Colonel Conroy (John Mahoney) arrives on the scene and their investigation reveals that Paul is responsible for stealing the plutonium. Suspecting him of terrorism the investigators search Paul's home and discover that he and Jenny have left for the science fair. The agents capture the couple in New York City and Mathewson who feels personally responsible for the crisis has a private talk with Paul. He convinces Paul to just give the bomb to the agents before a group of other participants at the science fair help Paul and Jenny escape from the hotel. In an effort to expose the lab Paul hatches a plan to return the bomb on his own terms. Ensuring Jenny is a safe distance away he calls the agents from a pay phone and walks into the lab with the bomb while being surrounded by snipers and agents. During the standoff negotiations stall and Paul arms the bomb. Mathewson convinced that Paul is not an actual terrorist attempts to intercede on his behalf. Due to radiation from the plutonium the bomb's timer suddenly activates on its own and begins to count down with increasing speed. Paul suggests taking the bomb to a quarry outside of the town but Mathewson advises against it telling Paul that the bomb is much more powerful than he believed. Desperate to defuse the bomb all sides put down their weapons and frantically work as a team to dismantle it. They manage to disarm the bomb before it explodes. After a brief moment of relief Conroy decides to arrest Paul. Mathewson refuses to cooperate and opens the door to the lab revealing a large crowd including Jenny and the press. The film ends as Mathewson Paul Jenny and Elizabeth all depart the scene.

They plan to commit several small-scale bank robberies over the course of a few days. Though the robberies are well-planned Tanner's wild nature leads to him taking unnecessary risks frustrating Toby. It is revealed that their mother has recently died leaving their ranch in debt due to a reverse mortgage which if not paid off in a few days will result in foreclosure on the property. Toby is determined to pay off the mortgage and because oil has recently been discovered on the land he plans to sell the oil rights in order to pay for a comfortable life for his estranged sons. Two Texas Rangers Marcus Hamilton and Alberto Parker are sent to catch the robbers. Hamilton who is close to retirement quickly determines the brothers' methods and personalities. Meanwhile Tanner robs another bank while Toby unknowingly waits at a nearby diner. After a third escape they take the stolen money to an Oklahoma Indian casino to be laundered. They exchange the stolen bills for chips and Tanner plays Texas hold 'em winning more chips. Toby then has the casino convert them into a check made out to the Texas Midlands Bank - the same bank whose branches they stole from in the first two robberies. With untraceable funds and gambling as a cover for how they were acquired the brothers head back to Texas to obtain more. Hamilton initiates a stakeout of another branch of the Texas Midlands Bank. The brothers do not show and Hamilton deduces a pattern to the robberies and determines their next target. Hamilton and Parker are en route when the final robbery indeed occurs there. Tanner decides to continue the heist even though the bank is full of customers many of whom are carrying weapons and a shoot-out ensues when a security guard fires at the brothers. Tanner kills the guard and an armed customer to effect their escape and Toby is wounded. As the brothers race out of town several of the armed townspeople pursue in their own vehicles. After gaining some distance Tanner stops and fires an automatic rifle at the pursuing "posse" causing them to turn back. The brothers then split with Toby taking the money and departing in a second vehicle left just outside of town while Tanner turns around to confront the Texas Rangers and local law enforcement. To give his brother more time to escape he draws the lawmen off the trail to a desert mountain ridge and takes potshots with a sniper rifle killing Parker. Furious Hamilton calls in the SWAT team then uses a local resident's knowledge of the area to sneak to a nearby ridge behind Tanner. Borrowing the local's rifle he takes Tanner out with a single long-range shot. During the standoff Toby manages to pass through a law-enforcement checkpoint without them noticing his bloody bullet wound and makes it back to the casino where he is able to launder the rest of the stolen cash. While he is at the casino he sees a news report of his brother's death. He delivers the casino's checks to the bank in time to prevent the ranch's foreclosure. Some time later after Hamilton has retired he returns to his former post to learn that the Rangers have cleared Toby as a suspect as his record is clean and he has no motive to steal since the new oil wells earn more in a month than the total from all of the robberies. The money from the oil wells is deposited at the Texas Midlands Bank and it is stated that they have not co-operated with the investigation into the robberies for fear of losing management of his family trust fund. It is also revealed that Tanner's prison sentence resulted from his killing of their abusive father in a "hunting accident". Hamilton confronts Toby at the ranch and makes it clear that he knows that the brothers were partners in the robberies and that Toby had masterminded the entire scheme despite what the Rangers and the banks say. Without explicitly admitting culpability Toby explains his motivations in wanting to keep his sons from experiencing a life of poverty similar to his own comparing it to an inherited disease. Both men are armed and Hamilton affirms Toby's right to self-defense while on his property but the tension between them is broken when Toby's ex-wife and sons arrive and Hamilton realizes Toby gave the farm and its profits to them. Hamilton departs as Toby suggests that they meet again soon to finish the conversation each of them implying that they may try to kill the other when the time comes.

First referred to as "Gay-Related-Immune-Disorder" we watch the effect of the disease as it devastates the lives of our protagonists. Jumping between Manhattan and Fire Island vignettes carry us from the it-couldn't-happen-to-me mentality of the early days of the disease to the invasive effect it has had on all of our lives today. The title of the film comes from the New York Times' refusal to acknowledge homosexual relationships in their obituary section during this period. Instead survivors were referred to as "Longtime Companions" of the deceased.

There is tension between Bottler and his old friends due to Bottler being the only one that matured since high school. Bottler now a car salesman at his father's dealership finds that his friends have not changed a bit since high school: the number one thing they still have in common is their love of Star Wars. The gang expresses their anticipation for the latest installment to the franchise The Phantom Menace. Linus proposes an idea that Bottler and he had been plotting since they were children to infiltrate Skywalker Ranch and steal a rough cut of the film but Bottler dismisses it. The next day Hutch and Windows meet Bottler at work and inform him that Linus is dying from cancer. The doctors estimate that he only has roughly four months to live; Episode I comes out in six. To make peace with his former best friend Bottler decides to go through with their plan and infiltrate Skywalker Ranch. The four begin their trip to Texas where they have to meet Rogue Leader a girl Windows is having an online relationship with for information on getting into the Ranch. While on the road Hutch decides to take a detour to Riverside Iowa (the future birthplace of Captain James T. Kirk) in an attempt to start a fight with some Trekkies. Hutch gets his wish after attacking a Trekkie by the name of Admiral Seasholtz in retaliation to Seasholtz calling Han Solo a bitch to which Hutch responds by running down their statue of Captain Kirk and Khan. The boys' van breaks down and they stumble upon a biker bar. Once inside they ask for help and a glass of water that costs $100. Hutch refusing to pay tries to pass himself off as a tough guy who just got out of prison only to discover that they are in a gay bar. In order to pay for the drink they are forced to become the "midnight entertainment" and strip to the music of Menudo which goes terribly wrong when Hutch displays his one testicle. They are saved by a man named "The Chief" who fixes their van after they pass out from eating guacamole laced with peyote. He gives a bag of it to Linus as a parting gift. After arriving in Texas Windows meets Rogue Leader who to his horror is a 10-year-old girl. The group is then assaulted by her uncle Harry Knowles who beats up Windows and tells him to never talk to his niece again. After explaining their situation Harry quizzes them to prove they are true fanboys then gives them information on one of his contacts that knows how to successfully enter Skywalker Ranch. They are told to meet Harry's contact in Las Vegas but on their way there they are arrested for fleeing a police vehicle and possession of peyote. Zoe arrives to bail them out of jail and - having traveled halfway across the country to get them - insists on accompanying them on their journey. Eric is reluctant to continue when the judge (Billy Dee Williams) gives him a message from his father to come home or lose his job but the others convince him to carry on by calling the journey their "Death Star" the one great thing that will live with them forever. Once in Vegas Hutch and Windows attempt to have sex with some girls while Bottler and Linus go to meet Harry's contact. They are shocked to find that his contact is none other than William Shatner who gives them the information they need and leaves. As they leave they are attacked by Seasholtz and his Trekkie friends who were attending a Star Trek convention in the same hotel. Meanwhile Hutch and Windows discover that the girls they were with are escort girls and flee when their angry pimp wants them to pay up. The group escapes their adversaries but Linus is injured in the process. When taken to the hospital Linus is informed by a doctor (Carrie Fisher) that he must return home for the sake of his health. When the group feels the situation has become hopeless Eric refuses to give up on their plan and manages to inspire the gang to continue reminding them that Star Wars means very much not just to Linus but to all of them. The group leaves the hospital and eventually makes it to Skywalker Ranch. Shortly after breaking into the ranch and marveling at the collection of original props and costumes used in the films they are discovered by security guards and are caught after a brief chase. The Head of Security tells them of their impending doom when he receives a phone call from George Lucas himself. Lucas tells him that he will drop all charges if they can prove to him that they are "fanboys". The five are individually quizzed including questions designed to show that they do not know much about the opposite sex (of which only Zoe is able to answer) after which the Head of Security confirms that they are fanboys and Lucas drops all charges. Being aware of Linus's illness Lucas allows him to watch the film alone while his friends wait outside. After the film ends Bottler joins his friends around a campfire and mends his friendship with Linus. Weeks later Linus dies of his illness. On May 19 1999 Bottler Windows and Zoe emerge from their tent they used to camp out in while waiting in line for the first showing of Episode I. Bottler has followed his and Linus's dream by becoming a comic book artist Hutch has finally started his own detailing business and Windows and Zoe are now in a relationship. Hutch arrives at the theater with beers he smuggled in which they use to toast Linus's memory. Just before the film starts Bottler comments "What if it sucks?"

There psychiatrist Dr. Mark Powell attempts to cure him of his apparent delusions. However prot is unwavering in his ability to provide cogent answers to questions about himself K-PAX and its civilizations. Dr. Powell introduces him to a group of astrophysicists to whom prot displays a level of knowledge that puzzles them. prot also exhibits total control over the other patients at the Institute each of whom believes unquestioningly that he is indeed from K-PAX. prot who claims to have journeyed to Earth by means of "light-travel" explains that he can take one person with him when he returns. Thereafter most of the patients at the Institute ask to be taken by prot on his journey back home. Upon learning that many of his patients expect to leave Earth on July 27 Dr. Powell confronts prot who explains that it is a predetermined date. However Powell believes this to be a significant date in prot's life a day on which he suffered a severe psychological trauma. Powell decides to subject prot to regression hypnosis which works well. Using information gained from these sessions Powell figures out that prot may simply be an alter ego of Robert Porter a man from New Mexico whose life had been devastated by the murder of his wife and child in 1996. On July 27 as the hospital staff watch the camera in Porter/prot's room cuts to static at the precise time prot said he would leave Earth. Powell finds Porter lying on the floor in his room catatonic prot having apparently left Porter's body for the light travel back to K-PAX. The other patients do not recognize Robert as he is being wheeled out of the room. In addition one of them is missing: Bess a woman who had remained mute since her home was destroyed in a fire and who had been among the patients that asked to go to K-PAX with prot. She is never found. Powell continues to take care of the catatonic Porter and tells him about how the patients he helped have gone on to live normal lives again but Robert does not respond. Powell is left with no absolute answer as to whether prot was in fact an alien entity or just a coping mechanism of the traumatized Porter but seems far from convinced that prot/Porter's behavior was a delusion. The final scene's voiceover is prot explaining to Powell that the people of K-PAX have discovered that our universe will repeat its events again and again so the mistakes we make will be repeated forever and prot encourages Powell to make this time count as it is the only chance we have. With this in mind Powell reconciles with his estranged son.

Their lethal scam was simple; they would swindle and then viciously murder lovelorn war widows who would answer their personal ads in which Ray would describe himself as a sexy Latin Lover. Ironically Ray's initial introduction to Martha was as a prospective mark. But when they met it was love at first sight perhaps as a result of their penchant for kinky sex and their mutual love for duplicity and easy money. With Martha posing as Ray's sister they bilked elderly spinsters and widows of their savings and then viciously murdered them in a bloodbath of sexual frenzy. When they were arrested Martha and Ray confessed to 12 killings although it is believed the actual number is closer to 20. At their sensational trial Martha and Ray cooed held hands and seemed as though they could not get enough of each other. Their plea of not guilty by reason of insanity was rejected and on August 22 1949 the homicidal lovers were sentenced to death. After numerous appeals they were electrocuted on March 8 1951 side-by-side in Sing Sing prison.

After getting used to taking care of her mom instead of the other way around Ansiedad decides to become in adult in every way possible. With that in mind she creates an outrageous list of all the things she needs to accomplish in order to become an adult. This coming of age story shows that growing up is never as easy as it seems and that the best thing to do is stay put. Working class Grace Gutierrez is all talk when it comes to improving her life. In the words of her current boss she's a bit of a flake. The problem of not taking action and not being responsible is that what she does affects her now mid-teen daughter Ansiedad. They recently moved to Seattle so that Grace could work toward getting a white collar job at Microsoft but instead she is a waitress at a cheesy seafood restaurant where she seems truly unmotivated to change. She is also dating Dr. Harford a married gynecologist. None of this sits well with generally bright Ansiedad who attends private school on part scholarship. So when Ansiedad learns about the concept of coming-of-age in her high school English class Ansiedad believes she has to go through the stereotypical literal process of it to come out the other end a mature adult who can take over the running of her own life responsibly regardless of what her mother does. Some of the many steps in that process include starting off an innocent then becoming rebellious by running with the wrong crowd and losing her virginity to the bad boy experiencing loss and death and ultimately running away to that adult life without need of her mother. Although it is all supposed to be an act she has to convince others that it is not except the one person in the know her best and only true friend Tavita. Being teenagers the question becomes whether they can emotionally handle what happens despite it all being an act especially if they don't have true responsible adult guidance.

Simmons	810	M	Matthew Modine	1378	M	Amanda Crew	1420	F	Josh Gad	1943	M	The film opens in 2001 with a middle-aged Steve Jobs (Ashton Kutcher) introducing the iPod at an Apple Town Hall meeting. It then flashes back to Reed College in 1974. Jobs had already dropped out due to the high expense of tuition but was still attending classes with the approval of Dean Jack Dudman (James Woods) who took him under his wing. Jobs is particularly interested in a course on calligraphy. He meets up with his friend Daniel Kottke (Lukas Haas) who is excited to see that Jobs is holding a copy of Be Here Now by Baba Ram Dass. Influenced by this book and his experiences with LSD Jobs and Kottke spend time in India. Two years later Jobs is back in Los Altos California living at home with his adoptive parents Paul (John Getz) and Clara (Lesley Ann Warren). He is working for Atari and develops a partnership with his friend Steve Wozniak (Josh Gad) after he sees that Wozniak has built a personal computer (the Apple I). They name their new company Apple Computer though there already is a company called Apple Records that is owned by The Beatles (Wozniak then teases Jobs that this is symbolic of his preference for Bob Dylan). Wozniak gives a demonstration of the Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club. Jobs is later approached by Paul Terrell (Brad William Henke) who shows interest in the Apple I. Knowing that he and Wozniak will need a studio in which to build them Jobs convinces his father Paul to allow them to use the family garage (set up as a carpentry/tool center) for his new company. Realizing that they cannot build these computers alone Jobs also recruits Kottke Bill Fernandez (Victor Rasuk) and Chris Espinosa (Eddie Hassell) to the Apple team. Terrell however is disappointed by the Apple I a reaction which inspires Jobs to start again with a second model. He hires Rod Holt (Ron Eldard) to reconceptualize the power supply for what would be called the Apple II. In addition after many failed attempts Jobs finally wins the interest of a venture capitalist Mike Markkula (Dermot Mulroney) who also joins Apple. They release the Apple II at the 1977 West Coast Computer Faire where it is a remarkable success. Suddenly Jobs and the company are very successful. The success also causes Jobs to distance himself from his friends and his high school girlfriend Chrisann Brennan (Ahna O'Reilly). When Brennan tells him she is pregnant with their child he promptly ends their relationship. Brennan eventually gives birth to Lisa Brennan whom Jobs continues to deny as his daughter. He also brings in John Sculley (Matthew Modine) to become the CEO of the company. As his behavior becomes more erratic (for example firing an employee for not appreciating his investment in using fonts) Jobs is moved away from The Lisa to the Macintosh Group where he works with Bill Atkinson Burrell Smith (Lenny Jacobson) Chris Espinosa and Andy Hertzfeld (Elden Henson). He also forces the original team leader of the Macintosh group Jef Raskin out of it. Though the Macintosh is introduced with a great deal of fanfare in 1984 Jobs is forced out of the company by Sculley in 1985. The film jumps forward to 1996. Jobs is married to Laurene Powell Jobs (Abby Brammell) and has accepted Lisa (Annika Bertea) as his daughter (she now lives with them). He has a son Reed (Paul Baretto) and is also running the company NeXT which Apple decides to buy. He is asked by then-CEO Gil Amelio to return to Apple as a consultant. Jobs does so and soon he is named the new CEO ultimately firing Amelio and his ex-friend Markkula (who refused to support him when he was forced out of Apple 11 years prior). Jobs becomes interested in the work of Jonathan Ive (Giles Matthey) and works to reinvent Apple. The film ends with Jobs recording the dialogue for the Think Different commercial in 1997. Before the credits there are original photos of all the main characters paired with clips from the film of the actor playing the part plus a dedication to Steve Jobs.

Two other tinker fairies Bobble (Rob Paulsen) and Clank (Jeff Bennett) teach her their craft and tell her about the fairies who visit the mainland to bring each season. Tinker Bell is thrilled and cannot wait to go to the mainland for spring. While out working she meets Silvermist (Lucy Liu) a water fairy; Rosetta (Kristin Chenoweth) a garden fairy; Iridessa (Raven-Symone) a light fairy; and Fawn (America Ferrera) an animal fairy. After meeting them she notices Vidia (Pamela Adlon) a fast-flying fairy who immediately dislikes her because of her unusually strong talent. Vidia challenges her to prove she will be able to go to the mainland and Tinker Bell creates several inventions which she shows to the Minister of Spring (Steve Valentine). But Tinker Bell soon learns from Queen Clarion (Anjelica Huston) that only nature-talent fairies visit the mainland. She tries her hand at nature skills; making dewdrops with Silvermist lighting fireflies with Iridessa and trying with Fawn to teach baby birds to fly but she fails miserably at all of these. Meanwhile Bobble and Clank cover for Tinker Bell when questioned by Fairy Mary (Jane Horrocks) the tinker fairy overseer. When Tinker Bell returns she tries to explain but Mary simply responds that she knows and expresses her disappointment with Tinker Bell's actions. On the beach Tinker Bell finds parts of a music box and figures out how to put them together. Iridessa Fawn Silvermist and Rosetta witness her doing this then tell her that she was tinkering and that she should be proud of her talentif this is what she's good at the mainland should not matter. But Tinker Bell still wants to go to the mainland. She asks Rosetta if she will still teach her to be a garden fairy but Rosetta says she thinks that tinkering is Tinker Bell's talent. As a last resort Tinker Bell asks Vidia for help in becoming a garden fairy. Vidia craftily tells her that capturing the sprinting thistles would prove her worth. However once she sees Tinker Bell making progress she lets the captured thistles loose and in attempting to recapture them Tinker Bell destroys all the preparations for spring. Tinker Bell decides to leave but after talking with the light-keeper Terence (Jesse McCartney) about how important his job is she realizes the importance of a tinker. Tinker Bell redeems herself by inventing machines that quicken the process of decorating flowers ladybugs etc. This allows the other fairies to get back on schedule thus saving the arrival of spring. Vidia is punished for prompting her to cause the chaos and Queen Clarion allows Tinker Bell to join the nature-talent fairies when they bring spring to the mainland. Tinker Bell is given the task of delivering the music box to its original owner (shown to be Wendy Darling). The narrator ends by saying that when lost toys are found or a broken clock starts to work "it all means that one very special fairy might be near."

Involved in little more than her studies Brooke notices Grace's hope-filled attitude and asks where Grace finds her hope. Grace replies "Jesus" and Brooke begins to read the Bible for herself. As Grace lectures on Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. Brooke asks whether their peaceful teachings relate to the biblical account of the Sermon on the Mount. Grace responds in the affirmative and relates parts of scripture to his teachings. One student immediately texts his parents about the class and the ensuing backlash draws the ire of Principal Kinney (Robin Givens). She reprimands Grace saying that the teacher's faith clouded her judgment. Grace is subsequently brought before the School Board who inform her that legal action will be taken against her as she has violated the separation of church and state. Grace's case draws the attention of Tom Endler (Jesse Metcalfe) a young defense attorney who is willing to aid her despite being an unbeliever himself. Martin Yip Josh Wheaton's college classmate visits Pastor David Hill (David A.R. White) to ask him several questions about God. Amy Ryan goes to the hospital to check in on her cancer only to find that it has miraculously vanished. She talks to Michael Tait of the Newsboys who encourages her stating that with faith prayers can be answered. Amy ponders this and later makes her blog a diary about her adventures with God. The School Board brings Grace's case before a judge in Little Rock Arkansas hoping to secure her termination and strip her of her teaching license unless she issues an apology which Grace refuses to do. To Brooke's horror confident prosecutor Pete Kane (Ray Wise) declares that the lawsuit will "prove once and for all that God is dead". His opening argument suggests that the society of the United States will crumble should Grace fail to be found guilty. Endler responds by stating that Grace was simply doing her job and that the law separating church and state was written by Thomas Jefferson in an effort to protect the church not persecute it. Kane builds a strong case against Brooke by bringing forward witnesses such as Kinney and Brooke's parents prompting Endler to rethink their defense. Meanwhile Brooke stands in solidarity with her friends against Kinney. The defense is dealt another blow when their key juror David becomes ill. Christian apologist J. Warner Wallace is called as an expert witness arguing that it is illogical to think that the gospel was a conspiracy because despite facing persecution and death none of the Apostles ever retracted the accounts of seeing the risen Jesus. Kane is floored to learn that Wallace was formerly an atheist who was converted to Christianity. Amy encourages Brooke to follow her heart despite what others are making her do. Martin is surprised to find his father in his college dorm. Mr. Yip angrily rebukes Martin for following God despite the family's sacrifices. Martin refuses to deny God and Mr. Yip disowns him then leaves. A heartbroken Martin goes to the church where he finds Brooke. They talk about God and Martin eventually brings Brooke to God. Later Brooke sets up a protest to support Grace. Brooke is allowed as a witness. Kane is able to trick her into admitting that it was Grace and not Brooke who initiated their first conversation about Jesus. As Grace becomes more and more discouraged Brooke and her friends sing her a song in an attempt to build up her spirits. Martin visits David in the hospital with his friend Paul and announces that he feels his call is as a pastor in China. Using a tactic to position Grace as a hostile witness Endler gets the judge to inform the jury not to let their bias or prejudices interfere with their verdict. The jury ultimately finds in favor of Grace who rejoices along with Brooke and Endler as Kane stands humiliated. In a post-credits scene a fully recovered David returns to church with Paul only to then be arrested for refusing to turn in his sermons to the government (shown earlier in the movie). Paul and Martin watch as David is taken away. Then Martin wonders what to do next and Paul replies that the best they can do is wait and pray.

Smith-Cameron	7014	F	Harriet M. Welsch (Michelle Trachtenberg) is an 11-year-old sixth grader and a young spy/writer who is best friends with Simon "Sport" Rocque (Gregory Smith) and Janie Gibbs (Vanessa Lee Chester). She lives a privileged life with her parents Violetta and Ben and her nanny Katherine "Ole Golly" (Rosie O'Donnell) who's the only person who knows all the things that Harriet has been snooping on. Harriet and her friends are enemies with a rich girl named Marion Hawthorne (Charlotte Sullivan). For a while Harriet lives life very well with being a spy and having fun with Golly. One night being home alone with Harriet Golly invites a friend Mr. George Waldenstein over. And after Golly accidentally burns their dinner the three go out to dinner and a movie instead where things turn into a disaster. Violetta fires Golly for letting Harriet stay out late but then she realizes that she still needs her to look after Harriet and begs her to stay. Golly tells her however that she was planning to leave soon since she believes that Harriet is old enough to take care of herself much to everyone's protests. Shortly before she leaves Golly encourages Harriet to never give up on her love for observing people just because she'll no longer be with her and promises her that she will be the first to buy her very own autographed copy of Harriet's first novel she sells in the future. After Harriet bids Golly goodbye she becomes depressed and withdrawn. She even gets caught when investigating the home of Agatha K. Plummer (Eartha Kitt). The next day she plays with her friends at the park and disaster strikes. Marion finds Harriet's private notebook and begins reading all of Harriet's vindictive comments on her friends out loud such as how she suspects Janie "will grow up to be a nutcase" and mocking Sport's father for barely earning any money. Everyone finds that they're all cruel and hurtful and even Sport and Janie turn their backs on Harriet. The kids then create a Spy-Catcher club and torment Harriet on her spy routes. After running into a police officer and then getting zeroes on her schoolwork Harriet gets her notebook taken away by her parents. Her parents tell Harriet's teacher Miss Elson (Nancy Beatty) to search Harriet every day for notebooks much to Harriet's embarrassment. One day during art Rachel Hennessey "accidentally" pours blue paint all over Harriet. The other students claim to help clean her up when they are really just smearing the paint around on her and when Marion pours more paint on Harriet's hair Harriet slaps her face with great force leaving a blue hand print. As a result of this Harriet does things to get back at everyone individually then exposes to them that Marion's father left her because he never loved her. She then carries out some of her other plans including cutting off a chunk of Laura's hair messing up one of Janie's science experiments which causes Janie's parents to punish her and making a fake picture of Sport in a maid's outfit severely humiliating the kids and strengthening their dislike for Harriet. Harriet's parents find out what she has done to her classmates and send her to be evaluated by a psychologist who assures them that Harriet is fine. Then things start to get better again. Harriet gets her notebook back and she even gets a surprise visit from Golly who tells her that in order to make things right again she has to do two things: apologize and lie. When Harriet tells her that it's not worth it Golly disagrees and tells Harriet that she is worth it as an individual and her being an individual will make others nervous (and keep making them feel as such) before finally adding that one of the blessings of life is good friends and tells Harriet to never give up her friends without a fight. Harriet then tries to apologize to Sport and Janie even though they reject her at first (they later however get tired of being treated unfairly in Marion's bully group and quit). She also shares her opinion with Miss Elson about how getting appointed as the editor of the sixth grade paper wasn't being done in a fair way and she get selected herself by her classmates who get Marion's occupation as the editor voted out. Through one article she apologizes to everyone including Marion and all (except Marion) accept her apology. All is well. On opening night of the 6th grade pageant Janie Sport and Harriet light off a stink bomb as revenge on Marion and dance to James Brown's "Get Up Offa That Thing" until the end of the film.

Between trying to keep the family farm up and running and her job in the village shop run by the slightly mad Mrs. Docherty she also has three boisterous children to look after Norman Megsie and Vincent. When her children's two wealthy cousins Cyril and Celia also then come to live with them Isabel requires childcare help. When Nanny McPhee arrives the children at first do not listen and carry on fighting which she soon puts a stop to. Meanwhile Isabel's brother-in-law Phil has gambled away his half of the farm and is being chased by two hired-assassin women under casino owner Mrs. Biggles. He desperately attempts to make Isabel sell her half of the farm using mean and spiteful schemes to leave her no choice. Isabel takes the children on a picnic during which an ARP Warden Mr. Docherty warns them about bombs and how he imagines a pilot might accidentally release his bomb. At the end of the picnic Uncle Phil delivers a telegram saying Isabel's husband has been killed in action. Isabel and everyone else believes the telegram but Norman says that he can "feel it in his bones" that his father is not dead. He tells this to Cyril who at first says it is just because he is upset but then agrees Norman might be right so the two boys ask Nanny McPhee to take them to London where Cyril and Celia's father works. There Nanny McPhee and the boys ask Cyril's father Lord Gray who is very important in the War Office what has happened to Mr. Green. At first Lord Gray sneers at Norman's disbelief at his father's death but after Cyril blurts out that he knows that his parents are getting a divorce Lord Gray checks what has happened. While he is gone Cyril tells Norman that he and Celia have been sent away because their parents will be splitting up and Norman asks where Cyril and Celia will live. When Cyril replies "with Mum I suppose not that it makes much difference she only ever really sees us when she wants to show us off" Norman tells Cyril that he and Celia are welcome to live on the farm with the Greens. Lord Gray returns and tells Norman that his father is not dead but missing in action and that there is no record of a telegram being sent to his mother. After the boys leave Norman deduces that Uncle Phil forged the telegram. While the boys were at the War Office Megsie Celia and Vincent were trying to stop Isabel from signing the papers and selling the farm. Just as Isabel is about to sign the papers a German pilot accidentally drops a huge bomb; it shakes everything but does not explode and is left sticking out of the barley field. When Nanny McPhee returns with Norman and Cyril the children go out to watch Mr. Docherty dismantle the bomb but he falls from the ladder. Megsie takes over and succeeds with the help of the other children and Nanny McPhee's raven Mr. Edelweiss. After Nanny McPhee helps to harvest the barley with a little magic it is revealed that old Mrs. Docherty is in fact baby Aggie from the first film about the Brown children and that Nanny McPhee has been staying with her. As Nanny McPhee walks away from the now happy family the children and Isabel chase after her only to see Mr. Green in army uniform and with an injured arm making his way to them. He runs to his family and they all hug.

Moore goes into the homes of ordinary people whose lives have been turned upside down; and he goes looking for explanations in Washington DC and elsewhere. What he finds are the all-too-familiar symptoms of a love affair gone astray: lies abuse betrayal...and 14000 jobs being lost every day. Capitalism: A Love Story also presents what a more hopeful future could look like. Who are we and why do we behave the way that we do?

The greedy geneticists working for Mr. Lance Strictland (Philip Baker Hall) led by Dr. Kozak (Robert Downey Jr.) have stolen a 300-year-old sacred dog named Khyi Yang Po (a Bearded Collie) from a Tibetan monastery. The scientists determine that Khyi Yang Po's genetic sequence when isolated and put into a vaccination invades and alters the cells and DNA of a victim.

Hidden in the laboratory Dave witnesses Dr. Kozak injecting company president Lance Strictland with a drug that will paralyze him for several months giving Kozak enough time to usurp control of the company.

He then begins to exhibit the same issues Dave had at the beginning of his adventure; Dave had successfully transferred the gene sequence into Kozak. In the courtroom Dave calls Kozak back to the stand and tries to get him to admit what he has done but Kozak manages to hide his secret. Thinking quickly he mocks Kozak by implying he was working under Strictland's shadow and angers him. The two begin growling at each another and the judge exasperated by Dave's canine behavior orders the bailiff to remove him. But Dave manages to spur on Kozak's canine instincts triggering a mutation in him after which he is arrested. The pharmaceutical company is returned to Strictland the mutant animals are protected and Dave is able to spend more time with his family.

Set on a long English summer in the early '80s SON OF RAMBOW is a comedy about friendship faith and the tough business of growing up. We see the story through the eyes of Will the eldest son of a fatherless Plymouth Brethren family. The Brethren regard themselves as God's 'chosen ones' and their strict moral code means that Will has never been allowed to mix with the other 'worldlies' listen to music or watch TV until he finds himself caught up in the extraordinary world of Lee Carter the school terror and maker of bizarre home movies. Carter exposes Will to a pirate copy of Rambo: First Blood and from that moment Will's mind is blown wide open and he's easily convinced to be the stuntman in Lee Carters' diabolical home movie.

They start to make a name for themselves at school as movie makers but when popularity descends on them in the form of the Pied Piper-esque French exchange student Didier Revol their unique friendship and their precious film are pushed quite literally to breaking point.

At the funeral her brother Todd (Stephen Root) and his wife (Wendi McLendon-Covey) try to persuade her to sell the house especially the possessions as she is a hoarder and has a habit of keeping discarded furniture she finds on the street. Her only close friend is the fiery Roz (Tyne Daly) though she gets along with her granddaughter. On her way to work where she has been working as a data entry worker for decades she meets a younger co-worker John (Max Greenfield) who she is immediately infatuated with. Empowered and inspired by cliched self-improvement tapes Doris decides to go after him. Doris finds ways to get John's attention though the attempts are frequently combined with daydream fantasies about a passionate love affair between them. With the help of her Roz's granddaughter (Isabella Acres) she makes a fake social media profile to find information about him and discovers that he loves an electropop band that is planning a concert in the area. Doris buys a CD for the band which gets John's attention and when she attends the concert she meets him and they spend time together. The band is intrigued by Doris and invites her backstage and has a fun evening meeting young artists in the area. John tells her that he and his girlfriend recently broke up over text and asks her about her love life. She reveals that she was engaged in the past but when her fiance left for a job in Arizona she had to decline in order to take care of her mother. When they part for the night John gives her a friendly kiss goodnight and Doris is in love. John is distracted for the next week and Doris discovers that he has a girlfriend Brooklyn. Though Brooklyn is friendly and charming and John likes her Doris is devastated. She spends the night drinking wine and in a drunken fit of anguish she post a comment on John's social media wall while using her fake profile posing as a scorned young woman whom he had a torrid love affair with. The next morning Todd arrives with her therapist planning on decluttering Doris's house but when his wife tries to throw out a pencil Doris stole from John she angrily throws them out of her house. Todd tells her that he's disappointed in her and she retorts that he was never around when their mother needed help. He says that it's what worked out best for his success and she tells him that she could have had those opportunities too. At work Brooklyn arrives and has a fight with John before breaking up with him; Brooklyn tells Doris later that she had seen the comment on his wall and accused him of cheating on her and she admits that she was cheated on in the past. After work John tells her about the incident and invites her to his Thanksgiving for friends. She agrees and when he asks her if she'd ever be interested in dating a younger man she assumes that he is interested in her. Roz tells Doris that she's deluded and that she's making a huge mistake by going after John but an infatuated Doris refuses to listen. She dresses up and goes to the Thanksgiving party where she meets John's uncle who is clearly interested in her. During the party she asks to talk to John in his bedroom. While trying to come onto him she reveals that she's always liked him and that she was the one to put up the comment that drove him and Brooklyn apart. Upset John rebuffs her shocked that his friend would break him up with a girlfriend he was so fond of. When a flustered Doris asks him what he meant by asking her if she was interested in younger men he admits he was trying to set her up with his uncle who is a decade younger than Doris -- thus a younger man. A hurt Doris leaves and invites Roz over for comfort. Doris invites her therapist over to declutter her house and she succeeds in cleaning her house. She also quits her job and says goodbye to John before she leaves. The two end on good terms and when Doris goes to the elevator to leave John calls her name and races out of his office telling her that he really is interested in her and wants to sincerely begin a relationship with her. After they kissed it's revealed it was the last one of Doris's fantasies and alone she enters the elevator to leave.

She makes dinner for her neighbor Bob Giffen (Evan Jones) and sings to him but when she proposes he turns her down saying she is "plain and too bossy"; he then leaves to find a wife back east. After a harsh winter three women from the community begin to show signs of mental instability due to the hardships they have faced. Arabella Sours (Grace Gummer) has lost three children to diphtheria Theoline Belknap (Miranda Otto) kills her own child after a poor harvest puts her family at risk of starvation and Gro Svendsen (Sonja Richter) a Danish immigrant is shown to be in an abusive relationship with her husband and suffers a breakdown after her mother dies. Reverend Dowd (John Lithgow) calls upon one of their husbands to escort the women eastward to a church in Hebron Iowa that cares for the mentally ill. One of the men refuses to participate in the lottery to determine who will escort the women; Cuddy takes his place and the lot falls on her. While preparing for her journey Cuddy encounters George Briggs (Tommy Lee Jones) a claim jumper who is about to be lynched for stealing Bob Giffen's land while he is away. Briggs begs Cuddy for help. Scared to make the trip alone she frees him and in return demands his help escorting the women. He immediately casts doubt on the job and insists he be free to abandon her at any time. To persuade him Cuddy tells him that she is mailing $300 to await his arrival in Iowa but secretly keeps it with her. Briggs's experience comes in handy when the group crosses paths with hostile natives and he is able to bribe them by giving up one of their horses. Later when Arabella is kidnapped by a freighter (Tim Blake Nelson) Briggs gives chase and the two men have a violent scuffle before Arabella kills her kidnapper. Eventually the caravan comes across the grave of an eleven-year-old girl that has been desecrated by Indians and Cuddy insists they stop and restore it. Briggs vows to push on so Cuddy stays behind and agrees to catch up with him. After restoring the grave Cuddy sets out on horseback. However she loses her way and after riding all night discovers that she has gone in a circle and her horse has led her back to the grave. Finally catching up to Briggs after another night of riding Cuddy distraught over having to wander the desert suggests they marry. Briggs like all the previous men rejects Cuddy saying he "aint no farmer" and is only along for the promised reward. Later that night a naked Cuddy propositions him and despite his initial protestations the two have sex. Rising late the next morning Briggs finds that Cuddy has hanged herself. Briggs chastises Sours Belknapp and Svendsen blaming their illness for Cuddy's death as he buries her body. He discovers that she had kept the $300 with her the entire time and so takes a horse and abandons the three women. However the trio surprisingly follow him on foot and Arabella almost drowns while chasing him across a river. Briggs saves her and decides to continue taking them to Iowa instead. Briggs seeks food and shelter at an empty hotel belonging to Aloysius Duffy (James Spader) who informs him that they have no rooms available for the caravan as a group of 16 investors are expected shortly and the women would sour the establishment. Briggs lashes out at Duffy whose men pull out guns of their own resulting in a brief stand-off. Briggs leaves but returns that night alone on horseback. He sends away the young cook instructing her not to look back and sets the hotel on fire and shoots Duffy in the foot. Briggs takes a roasted pig to feed himself and the women and exits the hotel leaving all inside to be burned alive. Briggs reaches Hebron passing the women into the care of Altha Carter (Meryl Streep) the wife of the church's reverend. He informs her of Cuddy's death but does not disclose the true cause. Guilty about having rejected Mary Bee's proposal he has a wooden slab engraved with her name and plans to mark her grave with it. He gives a pair of shoes to Tabitha Hutchinson (Hailee Steinfeld) a hard-working young maid at the hotel he is staying at and then proposes to her after advising her not to marry some young man going west but to stay in town. She replies by telling him "maybe". He then boards the river ferry heading back west and starts to sing a rowdy song with two musicians onboard. When asked to stop he chastises the people at the pier for wanting to go to the western territories calling the west a "goddamn devil". Briggs returns to singing and as the ferry departs one of the bargemen kicks Mary Bee's marker into the river.

Their mission quickly goes awry when CIA operative Carter Mason (Colm Meaney) turns up independently but with Reed already having infiltrated the settlement he is unable to extract himself and his cover is quickly blown. Captured by the locals he is interrogated briefly by Mason who threatens to emasculate him if he does not disclose the full details of his operation but he is swiftly freed by Slater much to the displeasure of the agent. Four years later both McCenzie and Reed have been dishonourably discharged from the army due to the influence of Mason and are running a struggling private security firm back in the USA. When McCenzie attends a biker gang-run poker tournament to barter for a loan to keep the pair financially stable he witnesses several other players draw guns on the dealer before it is revealed that the entire game was simply set up as a test for him to see whether he has retained his combat skill. When he is offered a well-paid job aiding freedom fighters on a tiny dictator-controlled European island he initially turns the offer down but when it is explained to him that Mason is on the island as head of the dictator's brutal military he changes his mind and he and Reed leave for Europe. On arriving at a base camp close to the island the full extent of his job is finally explained to him. The freedom fighters are poorly-funded and thus are sourcing money via war tourism inviting wealthy foreigners to join their ranks for the thrills and experience. To prevent them from risk of death however McCenzie and Reed have been drafted in to act as their tour guides and body guards offering them a realistic experience of army life while ensuring they stay out of harm's way. Their five charges (Roman St John Sam Haussmann Grimaud Tourneur Tommy Sin and Charles Herbert Vanderbeer) are for the most part all self-made millionaires who each believe themselves in one way or another to be up to the task of professional soldiery. As the two Captains give them a whistle-stop training the recruits - with the notable exception of St John (Sean Bean) - all reveal themselves to be hopeless though they do all gain a basic understanding of weaponry. In no time at all the five and their escorts are dispatched to their first mission but they immediately come under attack resulting in the death of Reed along with the rest of McCenzie's unit. As the Captain and the five manage to reach relative safety McCenzie turns on his charges accusing Tourneur (Ving Rhames) of arranging the ambush. Tourneur a black market weapons dealer counters by revealing his reason for taking up the holiday - he sold the dictator his arms but realised too late that his buyer had no intention of paying leading him to crave revenge. Short of options the group heads for the rebel base where the tourists discuss their reasons for coming Sin (Dominic Monaghan) revealing that his psychiatrist has suggested that his addiction to the violent video games he develops has left him disconnected with real life and in need of understanding the realities of warfare. Further treachery leads to a morning attack on the encampment and while the five tourists make it to safety they are all finally exposed to the horrors of war. While McCenzie returns to the camp to save the life of Cecilia the woman who originally recruited him the tourists opt to snipe at the attacking troops which draws attention to them and results in the apparent death of Vanderbeer (Charlie Bewley). As tourists and tour guide reunite and they flee the ambush St John directs them to a helipad attached to a mine complex and his obvious knowledge of the terrain forces him to reveal that he is in fact a mineral trader and a native of the island and has only returned in order to arrange supply of the rare and valuable metal coltan. As McCenzie again separates from the group to converse privately with Cecilia the remaining four again opt to launch an assault by themselves this time resulting in their capture. In prison they are reunited with Vanderbeer and though he initially plays innocent they rapidly realise that he is the traitor who informed Mason of the rebels' location; he reveals that he negotiated a deal with the dictator to sell the rebels out in exchange for money to replace his lost fortune having lost all of his wealth in a stock market crash. After McCenzie and Cecilia effect a rescue the group arm themselves before splitting up. McCenzie engages Mason Sin and Tourneur ambush Vanderbeer St John flees the compound while Cecilia herself is cut off from the men and leaves on a jet-ski. Haussmann (James Cromwell) sacrifices his life to hold off the rest of the dictator's private army thus fulfilling his own reason for coming to the island - to die heroically thus preventing his wife from gaining half of his assets from a pending divorce settlement. In a lightning-paced finale Sin kills Vanderbeer McCenzie avenges himself on Mason Cecilia is chased down by the dictator's daughter but succeeds in eliminating her also while St John opts to eschew an escape to turn around and save Cecilia from the floating wreckage. Tourneur wraps up the final loose end by killing the dictator with a well-aimed bazooka shot. As the island's inhabitants party into the night the five survivors toast Haussmann's sacrifice.

They meet Mathias (Joe Anderson) a German tourist who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas) Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers hoping to appease them but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins. At the top they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a cell phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans but to no success. In anger Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy whom the Mayans promptly kill. They realize the Mayans are afraid of the vines and won't let them go since they have touched them. Later Stacy and Amy descend the shaft to help Mathias and to find the phone. Jeff and Eric rig a backboard and bring Mathias out of the shaft. The next morning Stacy sees a tendril of vine has crept into a wound on her leg. The vines have also wrapped themselves around Mathias's lower legs and eaten them down to the bone. Eric and Jeff are barely able to remove the vines from Stacy but cannot get them off of Mathias. The cell phone is heard again from deep in the shaft so Stacy and Amy descend again. In a small vine-covered room the two find the body of the young archaeologist Heinrich's friend and a broken phone. They then realize that the ringing sound are made by the flowers of the vine. As Amy touches one flower the vines attack and the two barely escape. The group now realizes that the vines are predatory which is why the Mayans won't let anyone leave. As Mathias' condition worsens Jeff amputates his legs to avoid an infection. Stacy becomes jealous at Eric comforting a distraught Amy. Later she accuses them of having sex and claims that she overheard Amy moaning (the sound is implied to be made by the flowers). While the four argue the vines suffocate Mathias by creeping down his throat. In the morning Eric brings in Amy and Jeff into the tent and tells Stacey to show them what is on her back. She turns around and exposed her back and we can see vines under her skin moving. Eric pours alcohol over her leg to sterilize it and then cuts her leg to remove the vine. He then proceeds to remove the three-foot-long vine from her spine. After they remove the vines she tries to take the knife claiming that the vines are in her head. The next morning Stacey awakens and goes out of the tent where they are all sleeping. She finds a backpack and looks inside and finds a knife. Jeff heard moans coming from outside and goes to see what is going on. Then Jeff and Amy follow out with Eric. Jeff walks over to Stacey trying to calm her down as she has a deep gash on her forehead and is slicing up her thigh to get a vine out. He touches her and she flails the knife at him slicing his palm. He backs away. Eric then approaches Stacey trying to calm her down also. As he touches her back to calm her she spins around and fatally stabs him in the chest. As they try and calm Stacey the vines have wrapped themselves around Eric's legs and drag him into the bushes. Jeff sees a now unstable Stacy cutting herself paranoid that the vines are inside her. Overcome with remorse Stacy begs Amy to kill her. She is then killed off-screen. Jeff makes a plan for Amy to escape. He smears Stacy's blood all over her then carries her to the bottom of the temple and lays her on the ground. He then provokes and berates the Mayans drawing their attention away from Amy. The Mayans eventually shoot Jeff with arrows. Amy gets up and runs through the jungle with the Mayans chasing after her. Jeff is executed by the Mayan leader with a gunshot to the head. She reaches the Jeep and drives away. After Amy is able to escape Dimitri's two Greek friends are walking through the woods and come up to the temple looking for him. As they make their way towards the temple They shout Dimitri Dimitri.

Farroukh Erdogan is detained as the primary suspect and mastermind of the attack while his two alleged co-conspirators are killed in attempts to apprehend them (unseen to the viewer). Barristers Martin Rose and Claudia Simmons-Howe are selected by the British Attorney General to represent Farroukh in court after the previous barrister fell off a roof. The two barristers secretly had an affair in the past which became known to Martin's wife and has caused an alienation from her and their son. Due to the classified nature of the sources in the trial the trial is split into two divisions. Claudia will represent Farroukh in closed hearings to attempt to determine which classified pieces of information are required for his defense. Martin will represent him in the open trial using information allowed by the closed hearings. The two barristers are not allowed to contact one another. Claudia is watched over by MI5 agent Nazrul Sharma with very strict rules of accessing the classified information. Martin is assisted by friend and lawyer Devlin. The case quickly turns mysterious for both barristers. Farroukh and his family refuse to talk and simply state he's guilty. Martin and Claudia notice signs that they're secretly being monitored. Investigation into peculiar aspects of Farroukh's past leads Martin to discover that Farroukh was a secret MI5 agent who had been planted in a terrorist cell in London. It is never revealed whether Farroukh double-crossed MI5 or if the cell double-crossed him but in either case the terrorist attack was accidentally funded by MI5. MI5 is willing to kill to keep this secret and Farroukh and his family are admitting guilt in order to avoid assassination. Meanwhile a prominent American journalist Joanna Reece attempts to get close to Martin in order to get information about the trial but Martin is one step ahead. He eventually gets Joanna's help by sharing information she has on the case (though Reece is mysteriously murdered soon after). Martin secretly passes this information to Claudia. She brings the information forward in the first closed hearing while questioning high-ranking MI5 agent Melissa. The judge demands that Farroukh's son testify the following day as he was a major informant for MI5 in the case. When Claudia returns home an assassin attempts to kill her but she manages to escape. Farroukh's son realizes he is going to be killed and escapes surveillance. Martin Claudia and Farroukh's son spend the night evading Melissa and Nazrul during which Devlin is revealed to be working with MI5. The trio manage to deliver Farroukh's son to the closed hearing where he testifies but Nazrul kills Farroukh in prison and makes it appear as a suicide rendering the case closed. The Attorney General threatens Martin in private saying that he purposefully assigned Martin and Claudia to the case due to knowing their secret history and if he does not remain quiet about what Martin found during the trial he'll have the duo of barristers disbarred for their conduct during the trial. The closing audio of the film reveals the conspiracy is eventually revealed to the public.

Now past middle age Riggan is trying to establish himself as a true artist by writing directing starring in and co-producing with his best friend Jake what is his Broadway debut an adaptation of 'Raymond Carver' (qv)'s story What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. He is staking his name what little artistic reputation that comes with that name and his life savings on the project and as such will do anything needed to make the play a success. As he and Jake go through the process of the previews toward opening night Riggan runs into several issues: needing to find a replacement for the integral supporting male role the night before the first preview; hiring the talented Broadway name Mike Shiner for that role Mike who ends up being difficult to work with and who may end up overshadowing Riggan in the play; having to deal potentially with a lawsuit based on one of his actions to ensure success; needing to be there for his daughter Sam who he has hired to be his production assistant and who has just come out of drug rehab; and pleasing the New York Times critic Tabitha Dickinson who wants to use any excuse to give the play a scathing review which in turn would close the show after the opening night performance. But Riggan's biggest problem may be his own insecurities which are manifested by him constantly hearing what he believes to be the truth from the voice of his Birdman character who he often battles both internally and externally.

The virus becomes known as the Motaba virus and it's so deadly that it causes severe bleeding and liquefies internal organs killing within 3 days. The virus wipes out Motaba River Valley and a devastatingly huge fire bomb is dropped onto Motaba River Valley in order to reduce the chances of further infection. The bomb was dropped on the orders of corrupt General Donald McClintock even though an army surgeon General Bill Ford was against the idea. 27 years later in 1994 there is another outbreak in Motaba River Valley. At the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) located at Fort Detrick in Maryland Colonel Sam Daniels is doing research on the Motaba virus and so is his ex-wife Roberta Keough who works at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta Georgia. A monkey carrying the Motaba virus stows away on a ship that is heading for the USA and after the monkey's arrival people in Cedar Creek California start becoming infected by the virus. Sam and Roberta head into Cedar Creek with fellow doctor Casey Schuler and they start searching for the monkey thinking that the monkey is the key to finding a cure. Along the way Sam stumbles onto some information that may be of help -- McClintock has been concealing vital information from the president of the United States. Since 1967 McClintock and Ford have been in possession of E-1101 a serum that was made to cure the virus. McClintock has been trying to stop Ford from coming forward with this information and so far McClintock has succeeded. McClintock now wants to drop onto Cedar Creek the kind of firebomb that was dropped on Motaba River Valley 27 years ago. Sam and Roberta figure out that the virus in the Cedar Creek outbreak is a new strain of the Motaba virus -- an airborne strain that is even more contagious than the flu. When a new serum is made to stop the new strain Sam and Roberta set out to stop McClintock from having the town blown up.

Linda threatens to leave Josh telling him that he should only socialize with a higher class of people. Just before Madea's trial Ellen asks Josh how he knows Candace. He tells Ellen that they were close friends from childhood through college until one night when he took her to a party. He ended up going on a date and leaving Candace behind at the party where a group of his friends gang raped her in his absence for which Josh continues to harbor deep-seated guilt. After Josh asks Ellen to help Candace Ellen gets her a job interview but it results in sexual harassment by the interviewer who Candace kicks in the groin before storming out. At the district attorney's office Josh's best friend Chuck runs into Linda and discovers that she is falsifying Candace's file to deliberately get her sent to prison and away from Josh a practice she has been engaged with other defendants as well including Madea and Candace's friend Donna.

While in prison Madea befriends Candace and comes to her defense when she is sexually harassed by Big Sal. Candace Madea T.T. and Donna attend a class taught by Ellen at the prison in order to have time reduced from their sentences. During a lesson about forgiveness Madea notices that some of the inmates would rather play victim instead of taking the blame for their crimes. She tells the class they need to stop seeing themselves as victims and forgive those who led them on the bad paths they've been on as they weren't the ones who ended up in jail. Candace is moved by her words and during a visit with Josh she admits that back when she was raped at the party he took her to she called his name repeatedly as the attack happened but he never came for her. Candace held on to her anger at him for so long she forgot how to move on which resulted in her dropping out of school and becoming a drug addict and prostitute. But with everything she learned from Ellen and Madea she finally decides to forgive Josh and pick up the pieces of her life. On Josh's wedding day Chuck serving as best man tells him that Linda falsified Candace's file. During the ceremony Josh tells the congregation including his and Linda's boss what Linda has done and jilts her. Josh then rushes to the prison where he admits to Candace that he loves her.

Candace Madea Donna and four other women that Linda prosecuted have their convictions overturned and are released while Linda inevitably faces arrest prosecution and imprisonment on multiple charges including fraud evidence tampering and providing false legal documents.

Thomas bought the movie rights before Orlean wrote the book when it was only an article in The New Yorker. The book details the story of rare orchid hunter John Laroche whose passion for orchids and horticulture made Orlean discover passion and beauty for the first time in her life. Charlie wants to be faithful to the book in his adaptation but despite Laroche himself being an interesting character in his own right Charlie is having difficulty finding enough material in Laroche to fill a movie while equally not having enough to say cinematically about the beauty of orchids. At the same time Charlie is going through other issues in his life. His insecurity as a person doesn't allow him to act upon his feelings for Amelia Kavan who is interested in him as a man. And Charlie's twin brother pretentious 'Donald Kaufman (I)' (qv) has moved into his house with a goal of also becoming a screenwriter. Despite not admiring Donald as a screenwriter Charlie asks for his advice. Together they feel that there is some interesting subtext in the book on which Orlean herself can only elaborate if only Charlie has the nerve to talk to her. If she can't or won't elaborate they may have to find out the meaning of that subtext on their own.

Jackson is asked by a retreating General Barnard Bee for assistance against the Federal army who is pursuing them after a brief stand on Matthews Hill. In rallying his shaken troops Bee launches the name of Stonewall into history and the Confederates rout the Federals at Henry House Hill. Jackson maintains steadfast discipline in his ranks during the battle despite suffering a wound to his left hand from a spent ball. Meanwhile Chamberlain makes his transition from teacher to military officer and practices drilling his soldiers and is taught military tactics by Col. Adelbert Ames the commander of the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He is called to battle at the Union invasion of Fredericksburg. The Southern forces lead a fighting retreat as the Union army crosses the river and storms the town and there are scenes of the subsequent looting of Fredricksburg by the Union Army. Outside the city Lee Longstreet and Jackson have prepared an elaborate defense on Marye's Heights outside the town and the movie focuses on Confederate defenses behind a formidable stone wall. Several Union brigades including the Irish Brigade attempt to cross an open field and attack the wall but are thrown back with heavy losses by Confederate rifle and artillery fire. At one point two Irish units are forced into battle against one another to the anguish of a Southern Irishman who believes he is killing his kin. Chamberlain leads an unsuccessful attack against Jackson's defenses led by Brig. Gen. Armistead and finds his unit pinned down in the open field. He survives by shielding himself with a corpse until nightfall; eventually he and surviving members of 20th Maine are ordered to retreat and spend 2 nights in the field on the battlefield sleeping with the dead. Chamberlain and the defeated Union soldiers depart Fredericksburg. Jackson and Lee return to the city and Lee is confronted by an angry senior citizen whose house has been destroyed by Union artillery. Jackson spends the rest of the winter at a local plantation Moss Neck Manor where he contracts a friendship with a little girl who lives there. Later Jackson discovers the child has died from scarlet fever and he begins to cry. A soldier asks why he weeps for this child but not for the thousands of dead soldiers and another soldier states that Jackson is weeping for everyone. Jackson is soon reunited with his wife and newborn child just before the Battle of Chancellorsville. Outside Chancellorsville Lee identifies that the southern army faces an opposing force almost twice their size. Jackson calls upon his chaplain Beverly Tucker Lacy who knows the area and asks him to find a route by which the southern forces can infiltrate in secret. Jackson then leads his forces in a surprise attack on an unprepared Union 11th Corps. Although his men initially rout the opponents they quickly become confused in the melee and Jackson's attack is stalled - While scouting a path at night Jackson is caught in no-mans-land between the 2 armies and badly wounded by his own men who had mistaken him and his staff for Union cavalry counterattacking. During his evacuation his litter bearers are targeted by artillery and drop Jackson on the ground. He is then taken to a field hospital where his arm is amputated. Lee remarks that while Jackson has lost his left arm he (Lee) has lost his right. Jackson dies shortly after of pneumonia he had contracted during recovery. The film concludes with a scene showing Jackson's body being returned to Lexington Virginia accompanied by VMI Cadets and covered by the new confederate national flag just recently adopted followed by text explaining that shortly thereafter emboldened by their victory at Chancellorsville Lee decided to take the Army of Northern Virginia and march on an invasion of the north through Pennsylvania - a journey which would culminate with the Battle of Gettysburg.

Now middle-aged and married with a young son named Sam Phil runs a small vitamin store while Buck operates a local chain of sports stores. Buck is coach of the Gladiators the most successful little-league soccer team in the district. Sam is on Buck's soccer team but to his dad's annoyance his grandfather keeps him on the bench a humiliation he also visited upon his son decades prior. Buck eventually transfers Sam to the Tigers the league's worst team. At Sam's first game with his new team their coach is absent. Rather than forfeit Phil decides to coach the team a position he takes up permanently. However despite Phil's best efforts the team does not seem to improve. In desperation Phil recruits Mike Ditka (played by himself) who is Buck's neighbor and hated enemy. Enticed by the opportunity to beat Buck Ditka accepts the position. Despite grueling training the team continues to lose. Ditka introduces Phil to two exceptionally talented Italian boys working in a local butcher's shop. Phil succeeds in gaining their Uncle's permission for them to play for the Tigers. They have an immediate impact scoring repeatedly. The resulting winning streak makes them serious contenders in the league. After finally winning a couple of games and Phil said that his team was going to go to the finals Phil and Buck make a bet if the Gladiators win then Phil would sell his store and work for Buck. If the Tigers win then Buck would hand over his most prized possession 'The Pele Ball' a soccer ball struck by the famous player which Phil caught as a child and Buck took from him. Meanwhile Ditka also introduces Phil to coffee which rapidly changes him from a mild-mannered caring dad to an obnoxious over-competitive coach not that different from his father abusing kids and parents alike.

The Tigers make it to the finals where they face off against the Gladiators. At half-time the score is two-one to the Gladiators. In a heart-to-heart discussion with his son Phil realizes the error of his ways. He tells his team to do exactly the opposite of what he taught them. Although the Gladiators score one more goal after half-time they don't give up hope. Phil gives the goalie a vision test with glasses from the crowd. From there Ambrose scores one goalmaking the score three-two. After another goal the score is tied. The team rallys and produces a spectacular team performance to win 4-3 with Sam scoring the winning goal against his uncle Bucky (Josh Hutcherson) (Buck's child who was born on the exact day as Sam) using a move that he practiced when his dad benched him in the semi-finals. Honoring the bet Buck tries to give Phil the ball but Phil refuses. Making peace with his father they merge their businesses realizing there is more to life than winning. The film ends with an adapted version of the "He's Got Balls" commercial originally produced by Buck. In it the entire Tigers team appear announcing the merger of Phil's vitamin shop--Phil's Pills--and Buck's Sporting Goods Store. The team shouts after the "He's got balls" line "And vitamins." Closing credits are set to a cover The Beatles song We Can Work It Out.

Meanwhile the lemons who are led by weapons designer Professor Zundapp and an unknown mastermind secretly plot to secure their oil profits by using an Electromagnetic pulse emitter disguised as a camera (discovered by Finn on the oil platform) to trigger and destabilize the use of Allinol a fuel that was created by Axlerod and required for racers to use in the Grand Prix. McMissile and his partner Holley Shiftwell attempt to meet with American spy car Rod "Torque" Redline at a World Grand Prix promotional event in Tokyo to receive information about the mastermind. However Redline is attacked by Zundapp's henchmen but not before passing his information to Mater before he is captured who is then mistaken to be the American contact of Holley and Finn. Before killing Redline Professor Zundapp finds out that Mater was given the information. At the first race three cars are ignited by the camera and McQueen falls second in the race after Bernoulli due to Mater accidentally giving him bad racing advice shortly after evading Zundapp's henchmen with help from Holley and Finn.

While the race is being held Mater infiltrates the criminals' meeting just as the camera is used on a few more cars causing a multi car pileup while allowing McQueen to finish first. Due to the criminals plan causing Allinol to be perceived as troublesome Sir Miles Axlerod removes it as a required fuel for the final race. However when McQueen decides to continue using it the criminals plot to kill McQueen in the next race in London which spooks Mater causing him to blow his cover and allow him Finn and Holley to be abducted. Taken to the inside of the clock tower of Big Ben clock in London and tied up in it while the final race is being held Mater discovers that the camera did not function on McQueen but quickly learns the criminals are planning to plant a bomb on him in his pits causing him to break free and escape. Finn and Holley escape later but realize that the bomb is on Mater's air filter. Mater soon flees on the race course when McQueen (who arrived at the pits) chases after him while Finn apprehends Professor Zundapp. The other lemons soon arrive and outnumber Finn Holley Mater and McQueen but they are soon rescued by the arrival of the other Radiator Springs residents. Mater then uses evidence he had seen to reveal that Axlerod is the leader of this plot and placed the bomb on him whom he soon confronts and forces to deactivate the bomb before he and the other lemons are taken into custody foiling the operation. In the end Mater receives a honorary knighthood from the queen while Sarge reveals that he changed McQueen's fuel from Allinol to gasoline hence why the camera did not work on him. Finn and Holley ask if Mater can join them on another mission but he turns it down. The final scene ends with the World Grand Prix competitors racing each other at Radiator Springs.

She reluctantly takes a job as a janitor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Almost immediately Bridget is enthralled with all the old worn out money that is being shredded. She comes up with a plan to get her old lifestyle back by stealing much of that money which she believes is an easy job since the locks used on the money carts are standard equipment and as she notices that no one ever checks the garbage as she goes about her work. Her plan needs the cooperation of one person who works the shredder and one person who pushes the carts of money. The two people she co-opts are single mom Nina Brewster and diabetic trailer living and constant music listening Jackie Truman.

Nina vows to kill Bridget if she ever loses her children because of this scheme.

Against the odds Seabiscuit with his human team behind him does show his winning abilities and captures the imagination of all those others wanting to believe in a dream. But Seabiscuit's victories are at smaller races. As such Charles aims high and wants Seabiscuit to race Triple Crown winner 'War Admiral' (qv) who by all accounts is a winner and should be a winner. If given the chance to race against War Admiral (whose owner doesn't want to race as he feels he has nothing to prove) will Seabiscuit and his team continue to keep the dreams of the common Americans alive? Through the good and the bad especially as Red and Seabiscuit face mirroring problems they all have to decide what is in their collective best interest.

After the two decide to skip out on school to go on a special surfing expedition with friends for their 18th birthday the twins are expelled from their high school for truancy. Their father Elton Deedle (Eric Braeden) has become tired of their insolence and lazy lifestyle and thus decides to ship them to a boot camp to straighten them out. The boys are horrified that theyre going to have to fly state-side in order for this to happen as the camp is located in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. The boys arrive in Wyoming ill prepared for the far-cooler weather disembarking from their plane dressed in shorts flip-flops and hula shirts. They attract the attention of a small crowd when they summon a remote controlled crate containing a mini-bar that they use to create hula drinks. Afterwards they leave the terminal noticing a gruff looking mountain man whom they make fun of to their shock the man reveals a sign with their last names written on it indicating hes their ride. Major Flowers (M. C. Gainey) is already disgusted with their behavior on the drive back to Yellowstone from the airport Flowers reveals that his once successful camp was shut down by the childrens parents and their lawyers but the camp wasnt necessary anymore because he intended for the Deedles to undergo survival training. Flowers becomes distracted in describing his plan and fails to pay attention to the road eventually driving over the edge of a hillside and crashing into a river after an incident that caused some circus animals to escape from a circus truck. Thinking he had killed the Deedles he runs off thinking hell hide from the authorities. The Deedles awaken from their crash and find some womens clothing that had caught onto Flowers truck before it crashed since it was their only option for dry clothes they opted to wear them. After they begin to hike towards the parks main entrance they find some of their gear and decide to land-luge down a long hill with their hula crate remotely in tow. They bypass a long line of traffic awaiting entry into Yellowstone but unable to slow down or gain enough control of their boards they crash into the parks sign and are then collided into by the hula machinecracking their helmets off. When the Park Rangers arrived the only identity the boys had on them were the names Mel written on Phils sweatshirt tag and Mo written on Stews. After the incident the boys are carted off to the Ranger medical center and nursed back to health and decide to assume the false identities as it appears to be a one-way ticket to success and approval of their father. The boys find it difficult to live in their new identities as the park rangers have already learned that the real Mel and Mo are vegetarians thus the boys are forced to become such as well in order to maintain their cover. Because of their dimwitted surfer nature the boys do not click well with the commanding park ranger Captain Pine (John Ashton) although Phil falls for his stepdaughter Lt. Jesse Ryan (A. J. Langer) whom the Captain is very protective of. This leads to a series of accidents all of which the Deedles are to blame for and land them in disfavor with Captain Pine. Through their trials the Deedles inadvertently discover that an ex-park ranger named Slater (Dennis Hopper) feels hes been betrayed by the park the Rangers and mainly Captain Pine and so he has created a secret bunker underground near Old Faithful and has devised a plan to divert Old Faithfuls waterflow into a new geyser hes created on his own land which he is christened New Faithful. Unable to win any support for investigation from their fellow rangers the Deedles take matters into their own hands and attempt to thwart Slaters plan. However the real Mel (Ana Gasteyer) and Mo (Megan Cavanaugh) arrive at the Rangers base at a very untimely moment to reveal that Phil and Stew are not who they say they are. Though Pine was disgusted at this dishonesty he takes back his plans to have them dealt with after they save him from a raging river. Following Slater orchestrating Phil and Stew to cause an explosion near Old Faithful during a prairie dog infestation Mel and Mo oversee their removal from Yellowstone. As the Deedles are walking down the highway attempting to hitch-hike the big picture dawns on Phil and they devise a plan to get back into Yellowstone in order to stop Slater once-and-for-all. They rig a grappling hook into a grate in the roadway and as an unsuspecting car passes it would catch the undercarriage and tow the Deedles (who are wearing parachutes) essentially a land version of parasailing. From a few hundred feet up in the air they both notice a familiar stench and discover the person towing them is none other than Major Flowerswho becomes distracted by his stowaways and subsequently drives over a cliff (again) landing himself in a river. The boys parachute to the entrance for Slater's underground tunnel network and go underground where they locate and subdue Slaters two cronies Mr. Crabbe (Richard Lineback) and Mr. Nemo (Robert Englund). They devise a plan to re-divert the water from New Faithful back to Old Faithful and to escape by donning heat-resistance suits and escaping through the plumbing and through Old Faithfuls spout.

A hippie theater troupe The Earthlight Players rents the barn but can hardly pay any rent. Due to financial trouble the motel may have to be closed but Elliot pleads with the local bank not to foreclose on the mortgage and Sonia delivers a tirade about her struggles as a Russian refugee. The family is given until the end of the summer to pay up. Elliot plans to hold a small musical festival and has for $1 obtained a permit from the town's chamber of commerce (of which he is also the president). When he hears that the organizers of the Woodstock Festival face opposition against the originally planned location he offers his permit and the motel accommodations to organizer Michael Lang (Jonathan Groff). A neighbor Max Yasgur (Eugene Levy) provides his nearby farm land; first they agree on a fee of $5000 but after realizing how many people will come Yasgur demands $75000 which the organizers reluctantly accept. Elliot comes to agreement about the fee for the motel more smoothly. Initial objections by his mother quickly disappear when she sees the cash paid in advance. Elliot and Yasgur encounter a little bit of expected opposition. The local diner refuses to serve Elliot anymore inspectors target the motel (and only his) for building code violations and some local boys paint a swastika and hate words on the hotel. However resistance quickly dissolves in the tidal wave of peace and love (and commerce) brought to the area. The Tiber family works hard serving the massive influx of visitors and become wealthy in the process. A cross-dressing veteran Vilma (Liev Schreiber) is hired as a security guard. Elliot also struggles with hiding his homosexuality from his family when he connects romantically with one of the event organizers staying at the motel. On the first day of the concert Elliot his father and Vilma hear the music begin in the distance. Elliot's father transformed and enlivened by all the new life in town tells Elliot to go and see the concert. Elliot hitches a ride through the peaceful traffic jam on the back of a benevolent state trooper's motorcycle and arrives at the event. There he meets a hippie couple (Paul Dano and Kelli Garner) who invite him to join them on an LSD trip in their VW Bus a short distance from the crowd. Elliot has trouble relaxing at first but gradually melts into a psychedelic union with them. When they finally emerge after sundown Elliot watches the vast crowd and brilliant lights of the distant concert ripple with harmonious hallucinatory visuals that swell into serene white light. Elliot returns home from his liberating experience and has breakfast with his parents. He suggests to his mother that they now have enough money to replace him but she cannot bear to let him have his freedom. Elliot storms out facetiously suggesting his mom eat the hash brownies Vilma has just offered. After another beautiful day at the festival during which his friend the Vietnam veteran Billy (Emile Hirsch) appears to overcome his post-traumatic stress disorder Elliot returns home to find his parents laughing and cavorting hysterically having eaten Vilma's hash brownies. The once-brittle family (particularly Sonia) is united in joy and delirious affection. The next morning however Sonia inadvertently reveals that she has secretly saved $97000 in cash in the floorboards of her closet. Elliot is upset that his mother hid this from him while he put his own savings into helping his parents. After the final day of the concert Elliot decides to move to California as he packs up his things and says farewell to his father after his father encourages him to strike out on his own. As Elliot pays one last visit to the concert and looks out over the muddy desolation of the Yasgur farm Lang rides up on horseback and they marvel at how despite the obstacles the event was a success.

Part one: Director Nick Reve (Steve Buscemi) is shooting a low-budget independent film in the middle of New York City. The catering crew are under-funded and apathetic deciding not to replace a carton of milk that has been on the craft service table for a week. The scene being shot is a difficult one: a young woman Ellen reproaches her elderly mother (Rica Martens) for not intervening when the father beat Ellen as a child. However on the set just about everything that can go wrong does go wrong: shots are spoiled because of how the mic boom is visible; the camera assistant fails to keep the shot in focus; Cora the actress playing the mother forgets her lines; and Nicole the actress playing Ellen becomes increasingly unfocused and careless. A dispirited Nick calls for a rehearsal without camera to refresh the actors. However when Nicole (Catherine Keener) berates herself for acting badly Cora (Rica Martens) reassures her with a gesture that reminds Nicole of a similar gesture made by her own terminally ill mother. Nicole is so upset by the memory that she turns in an unexpectedly passionate performance; and Cora startled by Nicole's sudden intensity is equally good. Watching them Nick becomes enthusiastic all over again. Unfortunately it was not captured on film; cinematographer and camera operator Wolf (Dermot Mulroney) who has been diluting the sub-standard coffee with the spoiled milk was vomiting in the toilet throughout. Nick ruefully calls for another take. This time a sudden and insistent beeping sound distracts the actors. Nobody can tell where it's coming from; and Nick flies into a rage berating everyone on the crew and cast for their inadequacies. He then wakes up in his own bed; the beeping sound was his own alarm clock. He has dreamed the entire segment. It is 4.30am; and he is due on set. Part two: Early the same morning the film's lead actor Chad Palomino (James LeGros) is getting dressed in Nicole's hotel room. They have spent the night together and Chad suggests that they might get together again later; Nicole politely declines. Chad and Nicole arrive on the set separately. Nicole's character Ellen and Chad's character Damian have been in love for years but have never admitted it until the scene being shot on this day. Shooting the scene is made practically impossible by Chad's irregular acting. He keeps changing his mind about where to stand and continually moves to places where he is either invisible or badly lit by scenic light. Nicole becomes increasingly frustrated by Chad's egomania; and when he starts to stroke her head she briefly loses her cool then apologizes. An irritated Chad demands a private talk with Nick. He tells Nick that he has slept with Nicole and makes out that it was she not he who had wanted to continue the relationship. Desperate to keep Chad happy Nick agrees that Nicole is not very good. Nicole overhears this conversation on the sound mixer's headphones. Pretending to be contrite she asks Nick if they can improvise a little; but when they do so she announces to everyone that although she slept with Chad she is not at all interested in him. Chad loses his temper and quits the movie. Relieved that he will no longer have to please Chad Nick calls him a "Hostess Twinkie motherfucker" and a fight breaks out. Nick beats Chad senseless and fires him. He apologises to Nicole and confesses that he loves her. They kissthen Nicole abruptly wakes up still in her bed having dreamed the entire segment. Part three: Later the same day the crew is setting up for a dream sequence in which Nicole as Ellen stands still while a dwarf walks around her holding an apple. Nick claims to have learned a lesson from his own dream: That sometimes "you just got to roll with things." Nicole admits that she had a dream with Nick in it but doesn't tell him what happened. Nick manages to keep up his positive attitude despite the various mishaps that occur: The smoke machine fails to work then it catches fire then his senile mother Cora arrives on the set. However the ill-tempered dwarf actor Tito (Peter Dinklage) complains that the dream sequence is a cliche ("I don't even have dreams with dwarves in them!") and walks off the set in disgust. Nick's confidence collapses and he announces that the movie is over. At that moment his mother intervenes grabbing the apple moving to Tito's mark and announcing that she is "ready". The crew scrambles to shoot the scene and her manic performance injects fresh energy and conviction into it. Nick is delighted and decides to keep the new dream sequence and there is a tense moment while the sound mixer records 30 seconds of room tone. The entire cast and crew manages to remain silent and during this moment they each daydream about different things. They go on to shooting the next sequence.

Is she justified in placing her faith in the deeply-flawed Kelly? How will the children turn out? This underrated film provides an inspirational answer to these questions.

However Guy's carefully managed facade collapses when he comes up for the lead in S.R.O. studio's version of Ben-Hur. Things turn sour for the film idol when a fellow actor Freddie Stevens (Jack Plotnick) (famous in the film for portraying "Captain Astro" in a succession of Buck Rogers or Flash Gordon-type serial films) decides to steal the lead in Ben-Hur from Guy by taking a picture of Guy exiting a gay bar. Freddie plans to out Guy to the world and ruin his career. Jerry (Veronica Cartwright) Guy's repressed lesbian ball-bustingly ambitious agent connives to cover up the impending outing and ensure Guy the role in Ben-Hur by marrying her client off with great fanfare to the studio head's secretary Sally (Carrie Preston) who just happens to also be a slavishly devoted Guy Stone fan. However Sally isn't aware the marriage is a sham. To avoid his adoring new bride as much as possible Guy has Jerry sign him onto the next available film which turns out to be 'Blood Mine'  a disastrously arch pro-union film about the corrupt goings on at a coal mine (with lines like 'how can they call this a MINE when everything is THEIRS!?!'). The studio head in fear of the red-baiting going on in Hollywood at the time decides  true to Hollywood stereotype  rather than stop production on the film to instead water down the pro-union content wherever possible. The young idealistic and terribly handsome writer of the novel that the film is based on Rick Foster quickly gets roped into convoluting the plot of this already-bad adaptation of his heartfelt book largely because of a chance meeting between him and the film's star Guy. The attraction the two men feel for one another is instantaneous and propels the rest of the plot forward.

But none of them knows that something horrible is stalking their perfect family. On a fall afternoon in 1976 young Annie hears a noise from upstairs. Her mother has collapsed and died and an agonizing downward spiral begins. At UC Berkeley a brilliant research geneticist named Mary-Claire King is embarking on something of a personal crusade to uncover the genetic roots of breast cancer. While still in her twenties she has already made a famous discovery that made the cover of Sciencequantifying the genetic variation between humans and chimpanzees. But her conviction that there is a hereditary basis to at least some forms of breast cancer is not widely shared. Nevertheless her tireless research throughout the 1980s would end in a medical breakthroughthe discovery of the location of the BRCA1 hereditary breast cancer geneconsidered one of the most important scientific discoveries of the twentieth century. At the age of 19 after the sudden death of her father Anne marries Paul and soon is pregnant. She struggles to find a way in the world with her equally young but misguided husband and her older sister Joan Parker who tries to become a surrogate parent to Anne. But cruelly Joan contracts the same cancer that killed their mother and in a few months she too is dead. Annie is diagnosed with the same disease that killed her mother and sisterbreast cancer. It is severe and surgery and chemotherapy with all its accompanying difficulties soon follows. She loses her hair and if that wasn't enough to endure her husband never really mature or stable has begun an affair with Annes closest friend Louise and leaves her. Ironically Paul is soon diagnosed with cancer and expires shortly before she is diagnosed with a second cancer. With the help of a young doctor Sean and a new friend Kim Anne continues her fight. As each tragedy befalls her she grows stronger. While Annie struggles King is pursuing her belief that some forms of breast and ovarian cancer have a hereditary basis. While she captures headlines for her work applying DNA fingerprinting to help reunite "the disappeared" with their families in Argentina her priority is to map the breast cancer gene. King focuses on collecting families with a particularly high incidence of breast cancer suspecting that these cases are most likely to reveal any genetic predispositions. Advances in genetic mapping through the 1980s gradually allow her team to embark on studies to map the location of the BRCA1 gene. Finally in 1990 King and her team find conclusive evidence linking DNA markers on chromosome 17 with an inherited flaw in a gene dubbed BRCA1. The work was presented at the American Society of Human Genetics conference in Cincinnati and published in Science magazine a short time later. Mary Claire King ended up on the cover of Time magazine and Anne Parker finally had the answer she herself had long sought. Anne Parker happily remarried and a few years later contracts cancer for a third time. And survives again. And she laughed while being treated for reasons only she knew and understood.

Then after making the once-undefeated Hammerman fall to the ground Bone is offered a deal by James.

That night Bone discovers that Roberto has been murdered in front of the apartment mauled to death by James' dogs because he witnessed one of James' street killings.

James' bodyguard Teddy D and his thugs head to the rehab clinic to pick up Angela only to have Bone and Pinball dispatch them. Transmitting his location through Teddy D's GPS phone James has the duo follow him to McVeigh's mansion.

In the middle of the melee Bone blocks a sword slash causing James to cut off his own hand. He runs off before the police arrive at the mansion to arrest James. The next day Angela is reunited with Jared. Tamara who had threatened to kick Bone out due to his association with James offers him to stay; he declines saying he will only cause further trouble. Before exiting the apartment he leaves her an envelope full of cash and asks her to take Angela in once she is rehabilitated. He also parts ways with Pinball saying he has business to take care of. During the end credits James is attacked and sodomized in prison by JC and his gang.

Finding himself suffering existential angst Qohen constantly waits for a phone call hoping that it might bring him happiness or the answers he seeks. Requesting a "disability" evaluation three company doctors determine that Qohen is physically healthy but request he have therapy from Dr Shrink-ROM an AI therapist designed to provide mental evaluation. Wanting to meet with "Management" Qohen attends a party held by his supervisor Joby. Stumbling into an empty room Qohen finds Management and requests to work from home as he would be more productive and would no longer risk missing his call; Management simply notes he finds Qohen "quite insane". Attempting to leave the party Qohen is pressed into staying by Joby and when Qohen starts choking on an olive he is rescued by partygoer Bainsley. His request granted by Management Qohen is informed he is to start working from home and is shown a massive supercomputer dubbed "The Neural Net Mancive"; containing all of the entities crunched by workers Qohen is required to order its data to solve the "Zero Theorem" a mysterious mathematical formula. Spending months as a hermit whilst working on the program he is diagnosed with numerous conditions by Shrink-ROM and begins suffering nightmares involving a black hole. Frustrated with his work Qohen smashes his computer with a hammer and is soon visited by Bainsley. Qohen confides in Bainsley that he believes he accidentally hung up a call that would have given him the meaning of life and has desperately been waiting for a call-back ever since. Qohen is then visited by Bob the teenage son of Management. Bob repairs his computer reveals Management is spying on him and suggests that Bainsley is only interested in Qohen because she is paid to be. After Qohen insists he will cease working on the Zero Theorem Bob promises to get him his call if he continues. Having received a VR suit from Bainsley Qohen interacts with her through virtual reality which makes them both appear on a beach together. When Qohen asks if the sun in the horizon ever sets Bainsley responds it is not programmed to do so. They soon kiss one another. Visited again by Bob Qohen to his distaste learns the Zero Theorem aims to prove life is meaningless through the Big Crunch theory. Digitally connecting to Bainsley again Qohen is comforted by her but when he denounces Management and suggests eloping together she forcefully disconnects damaging Qohen's suit. When Bob then takes his suit to repair it Qohen connects to Bainsley unannounced only to discover she is a webcam stripper. Bob returns with Qohen's suit now repaired and reveals his phone call is only a delusion and admits his Dr. Shrink-ROM was only designed to identify his pathology rather than treat it. Qohen is visited by Bainsley who apologizes for deceiving him but claims she truly fell in love with him; despite Bainsley's offer to elope which is encouraged by Bob Qohen turns her down. Qohen discussing his problems with Bob discovers Bob's health is radically declining. Caring for Bob Qohen finds a hidden camera in his bathroom mirror and begins to uncover and smash Management's cameras. Despite barricading his home Management employees break in and take Bob away. Visited by Joby Qohen is berated by him as his actions got Joby fired. Qohen dons his now "repaired" virtual reality suit and connects to his computer but is nearly electrocuted. Appearing at the Neural Net Mancive Qohen is greeted by an image of Management who notes that Bob is hospitalized because of his declining health which is due to a chronic illness. Management explains Qohen is now part of the Neural Net and when Qohen asks questions about the meaning of his life Management explains that there is none and that he was never a higher power able to grant Qohen his call. Management explains that while the Zero Theorem would prove that everything is meaningless the entire purpose of Mancom in "crunching entities" was to bring order to disorder finding meaning in some form that he could sell. Management explains he chose Qohen to solve the Zero Theorem as he was its effective antithesis since he had faith in finding meaning waiting endlessly for his phone call. Management then disappears apologizing as he no longer needs Qohen; angered Qohen smashes the Neural Net collapsing it and revealing a black hole inside. Smiling Qohen jumps into it only to appear back on the virtual beach. Resigned calm and alone Qohen stands in front of the sea and after interacting with the sun watches the sunset he causes. As the credits roll Bainsley is heard calling Qohen hinting that either Bainsley has joined him or he has conjured her up in his virtual world.

Idealistic 'Erin Gruwell' (qv) is just starting her first teaching job that as freshman and sophomore English teacher at Woodrow Wilson High School which two years earlier implemented a voluntary integration program. For many of the existing teachers the integration has ruined the school whose previously stellar academic standing has been replaced with many students who will be lucky to graduate or even be literate. Despite choosing the school on purpose because of its integration program Erin is unprepared for the nature of her classroom whose students live by generations of strict moral codes of protecting their own at all cost. Many are in gangs and almost all know somebody that has been killed by gang violence. The Latinos hate the Cambodians who hate the blacks and so on. The only person the students hate more is Ms. Gruwell. It isn't until Erin holds an unsanctioned discussion about a recent drive-by shooting death that she fully begins to understand what she's up against. And it isn't until she provides an assignment of writing a daily journal - which will be not graded and will remain unread by her unless they so choose - that the students begin to open up to her. As Erin tries harder and harder to have resources provided to teach properly (which often results in her needing to pay for them herself through working second and third jobs) she seems to face greater resistance especially from her colleagues such as Margaret Campbell her section head who lives by regulations and sees such resources as a waste and Brian Gelford who will protect his "priviledged" position of teaching the senior honors classes at all cost. Erin also finds that her teaching job is placing a strain on her marriage to Scott Casey a man who seems to have lost his own idealistic way in life.

None of the people at the party even recognize that she is dressed like Britney Spears during the early period of her career. Brueder and friends engage in behavior such as binge drinking farting in her cell phone and causing other juvenile chaos. At a haunted house later that night Wren and April run into her nerdy friend Roosevelt and his friend Peng dressed as Aaron Burr complete with an 1814-style pistol. During this time she finds out that Albert has wandered so she must find him. On his own Albert meets a convenience store employee named Fuzzy who seeks revenge against Jorgen a mixed-martial arts fighter who won the heart of his ex-girlfriend Lara. Recognizing Albert for his well known reputation from a video arcade he seeks his help to get even with his ex and the boy accepts his offer and friendship. Wren and April just miss him at the convenience as Fuzzy drives off with Albert and they both encounter Roosevelt and Peng again. Wren coerces Roosevelt into driving his mother's car around the city to look for her little brother. Roosevelt's parents are semi-eccentric pacifistic lesbians and Wren previously thought his reference to them as his "Moms" was an attempt to mimic rappers such as Li'l Wayne. Roosevelt asks his mothers to borrow the car but when they insist that he asks it in ancient Greek; he does so and they say no. Citing his lack of ability to translate the word "seat belt" into ancient Greek he sneaks the keys to the car and drives off with them anyhow. The car is a yellow 1986 Volvo 245 station wagon with mechanical issues. Peng turns on the car stereo which is set to an NPR station and as he and Roosevelt fight over it the knob breaks causing it to blare Josh Groban's cover of "You Raise Me Up" thus making them appear uncool as they roll onto a street that's popular for kids who cruise with their cars at night. To make matters worse the car stalls right in front of the SUV driven by Mike Puglio the "Wedgie King" and his sidekick dressed like The Incredible Hulk. Both harass the four kids until one of them bangs on the hood causing it to start up again giving them an opportunity to escape. Across town Fuzzy and Albert arrive at Lara's apartment building and he climbs the building to throw toilet paper all over her apartment while Albert keeps lookout for the police only to find that he not only threw it into the wrong apartment (Lara's was the one next to it) but he also accidentally set it on fire from some candles. The owners of the wrong apartment turn out to be a Samoan couple who begin to beat Fuzzy but he manages to escape. During this time a police tow truck confiscates his car for parking in a tow-away zone not noticing what's going on in the building but not before Albert climbs in the back seat to retrieve his Halloween candy. Fuzzy tells Lara about Albert and how his car was towed away. She doesn't believe him but goes along with it anyhow. Wren suspects that Albert might be at a local Captain Chicken restaurant a pirate-themed fast food chain that has a giant statue of a chicken with an eye-patch and a hook on one wing. Again they arrive just too late to find him almost running him over while fleeing Mike Puglio before he is rescued by Denise a young college girl dressed in a "Galaxy Scout" (a fictional anime character) costume and is invited to another party. The four kids ask the girl in the drive-thru window about Albert's whereabouts but have no success. While leaving they find their way out of the drive-thru blocked off by Puglio. Roosevelt tries to get away from the bullies but instead he crashes the car into the statue of the chicken which lands on the car and appears to be engaging in doggy-style sex with it. The whole incident embarrasses April to the point of tears provoking Peng to get out of the car and challenge the bully to a duel. Initially Puglio does not take the challenge seriously believing the gun is not real until he fires it at him blowing apart a chicken drumstick Puglio used as a mock weapon. The drive-thru girl calls the police and Puglio and his friend flee the scene while April escapes. Police officers arrive and try to arrest the three of them but they drive off only to find their patrol car covered with toilet paper. Albert seems to be having a good time with Denise and her friends until Jorgen crashes the party and takes some of his candy throwing most of it on the ground and tries to dance with the girls at the party who throw him out. Remembering Fuzzy's description of Jorgen Albert stows away in his convertible just as Fuzzy and Lara arrive at the same party which Lara wanted to attend. Denise and her friends tell them that they were partying with Albert and Lara soon realizes Fuzzy was telling the truth just before Jorgen throws Albert's Halloween pumpkin basket at Fuzzy who suddenly spots Albert in the backseat of Jorgen's car evidently with his own revenge plot. Wren Roosevelt and Peng drive off looking for both Albert and now April who later calls from Aaron Riley's party with the false impression that she has found Albert. Wren Roosevelt and Peng arrive at the party and for at least this night the earlier duel gives Peng some level of social acceptance whereas he had previously became convinced he and Roosevelt were pre-destined to be social outcasts. Wren calls the police to ask if Albert has been arrested since he gets into a lot of mischief but Albert was still out there. Later April fulfills a promise she made earlier to Peng to let him touch her breasts. When he gets nervous about the chance to feel her up she grabs his hand and puts it on one of them herself but still tries to conceal her own desire for him by slapping his face in case anybody saw them together. Seeking to escape Keevin and the party Joy tries to find the bathroom and unexpectedly stumbles upon Brueder's parents. All three share a cup of tea and Joy tearfully confesses that she's dating their son's friend not only to compensate for the loss of her husband but also the potential loss of her daughter to college and her son to silence. Eventually she leaves the party and returns home discovering the children are not home. Jorgen arrives at his home unaware that Albert stowed away in his car. Soon after Fuzzy arrives and he and Albert hatch a plan to get revenge on Jorgen by leaving a flaming bag of dog feces and fireworks on his front porch. When Jorgen investigates what's going on the bag explodes hurting his foot. He spots Albert but not Fuzzy. Albert attempts to run away but Jorgen catches him and locks him in his bedroom leaving Fuzzy to come up with a rescue/revenge plan. Back at Aaron Riley's party just as Roosevelt is about to confess his love for Wren Aaron Riley sings a song dedicated to Wren but she turns him down and tries to chase Roosevelt as he drives away in frustration. Just then Wren receives a phone call on her cell phone from Jorgen who is holding Albert hostage at his house and threatens to turn him over to the police for pulling the stunt with Fuzzy unless she gives him $400 in cash which she doesn't have. After Jorgen gives her his address Wren desperately runs through the streets of Cleveland trying to find his house. Arriving there and telling Jorgen she doesn't have the money he calls the police but puts them on hold when Wren finds out that he is a big fan of the Beastie Boys and offers to give him the collectible jacket she inherited from her late father which was left behind by Mike D as a substitute for cash. Jorgen seems satisfied and takes it as a better offer but he decides to turn them over to the police anyhow. Just then Fuzzy breaks in to rescue the boy and his older sister by throwing bricks and fireworks throughout the house. Jorgen is slightly injured in the explosion. Before the police arrive Fuzzy strips down naked and runs off in order to divert attention from the two kids. Wren and Albert visit the cemetery where their father is buried and place a plastic pumpkin with flowers on his grave. Albert thanks Wren for finding and rescuing him just before their mother picks them up and drives them home. It is morning when they arrive home. Upon their arrival they find Roosevelt trying to prevent Wren's mother from entering her house without the opportunity to profess his love for her something which he was encouraged to do by his parents despite coming home with the Volvo severely damaged and confessing to them about the night's events. Meanwhile April wakes up to find herself in the arms of Peng and after looking around for witnesses decides to make out with him again. Fuzzy meets Denise who asks him out on a date. Fuzzy also reveals that his real name is Manuel. Later Albert reveals that he secretly has been pulling prank phone calls on both his mother sister and his sister's friend for six months which includes the uploading of a video to Wren's Facebook page making fun of Wren's bug dance and "explaining rap" that she did during the period of Riley's invitation.

Yet after Jazzy refused to pay the women they contended they were raped leading to Andre's arrest. After the limo gets hit by a cab Andre and Chelsea wander the city.

The truth devastates Andre who angrily tells Chelsea he felt he was never funny unless he was drunk or high and now is fearful for his career. Despondent and acting out at a supermarket he is arrested by police. In jail Andre calls Erica who fumes over the arrest mainly because of how it will look for her image. She tells Andre this piece of fame is all she has since she thinks she has no other talent. Erica's manager Benny takes the phone and tells Andre to go to his bachelor party for good press and fly out for the wedding. Andre's bodyguard Silk bails out Andre and they go to a strip club for a bachelor party with a theme based on Hammy The Bear.

After the performance he tells Chelsea he got inspired to return to standup after being in jail and talking to DMX who told Andre he does not want to keep rapping and wants to sing instead. He then sings Smile terribly. They drop Chelsea off at her place where she and Andre share one last kiss before departing. Andre asks her her top five rappers which she lists. While driving away Silk tells Andre he should have gone after Chelsea. Andre goes through the gift bag from the party and finds items including a scented candle and a bottle of vodka. Then he pulls out a slipper and Silk smiles. After the credits begin rolling the movie returns to the party where Jerry Seinfeld shares his "top five" as Sugarhill Gang Eminem Wale Ice Cube and Sir-Mix-A-Lot.

They show her a mystical moonstone and explain to her its tremendous powers. Every eight years there is a blue harvest moon in Pixie Hollow. When the light of this rare blue moon passes through the moonstone it creates blue-colored pixie dust to strengthen and rejuvenate the pixie dust tree. The Autumn Revelry is the associated event during which the fairies gather to collect the dust. A new scepter is to be made to raise the moonstone and Tinker Bell has been recommended. Although Tinker Bell has made mistakes in the past Fairy Mary explains that tinker fairies learn from them most of the time. Tinker Bell accepts the task as well as help from Terence.

Blaze then sheds light on the map to help Tink and the tinker finally allows him to stay. As the duo's adventure continues Tink thinks she has stumbled upon the stone arch that is said to lead way to the mirror. She leaves the balloon to make sure of this and leaves Blaze to watch over it. Once Tink flies off however the balloon begins to stray away. After unsuccessfully trying to anchor it Blaze rushes to tell Tink though she is too busy trying to figure out why she stumbled upon a bent tree instead of the stone ark to notice Blaze. When she finally sees the balloon floating off she gives chase Blaze in tow but the harsh winds knocks them down. The next morning Tinker Bell awakens hungry and lost. Blaze scouts out to rally some forest insects that provide food and water for Tink. They also lead her and Blaze to the stone arch and the adventure continues.

She blames Blaze for distracting her but then realizing that her temper is what had gotten her in trouble in the first place she apologizes and breaks down crying. She is found by Terence who has been following her after discovering her plans and the fragments of the moonstone in her empty house. They reunite but then they are chased by rats.

When she unveils the scepter the assembled fairies are all shocked and alarmed to see the fragments of the precious moonstone.

Many years later an adult Noah is living with his wife Naameh and their sons Shem Ham and Japheth. After seeing a flower grow instantly from the ground and being haunted by dreams of a great flood Noah takes them to visit his grandfather Methuselah. They encounter a group of people recently killed and adopt the lone survivor a girl named Ila. Noah and his family are chased by the murderers and seek refuge with the fallen angels known as the "Watchers" confined on Earth as stone golems (nephilim) for helping humans banished from the Garden of Eden. Methuselah gives Noah a seed from Eden and tells Noah that he was chosen for a reason. Returning to his tent that night Noah plants the seed in the ground. The Watchers arrive the next morning and debate whether they should help Noah until they see water spout from the spot where Noah planted the seed. Once a forest grows instantly the Watchers agree to help Noah and his family build an ark. After birds fly to the ark Tubal-cain arrives with his followers and confronts Noah. Noah defies Tubal-cain and remarks that there is no escape for the line of Cain. Tubal-cain retreats and decides to build weapons to defeat the Watchers and take the ark. As the ark nears completion animals of various species enter the ark and are put to sleep with incense. With Ila having become enamored of Shem Noah goes to a nearby settlement to find wives for Ham and Japheth but upon witnessing the settlers' exchanging their daughters for food he abandons his effort and begins believing that the creator wants all of humanity dead. Back at the ark he tells his family that he will not seek wives for his younger sons. After the flood they will be the last humans and there will be no new human generations. Devastated that he will be alone his entire life Ham runs into the forest. Naameh begs Noah to reconsider but when he will not she goes to Methuselah for help. Later in the forest Ila encounters Methuselah who cures her infertility. Meanwhile Ham searching for a wife on his own befriends the refugee Na'el. After it starts raining Tubal-cain becomes angry that he was not chosen to be saved and incites his followers to make a run for the ark. Noah finds Ham in the forest and forces Ham to save himself but leaves Na'el to die when she is caught in an animal trap. Noah's family enter the ark except for Methuselah who remains in the forest and is swept away by the rushing waters. The Watchers hold off Tubal-cain and his followers as long as possible sacrificing themselves to protect the ark from the mob before ascending to heaven. As the flood drowns the remaining humans an injured Tubal-cain climbs onto the ark and solicits Ham playing on anger toward Noah for allowing Na'el to die. Ila discovers that she is pregnant as the rains stop and begs the creator to let the child live. Noah interprets the ending of the rain to mean he must ensure the extinction of humans and against his wife's protests resolves that if the child is a girl he will kill her. Months pass and Ila and Shem build a raft to escape Noah's resolve but Noah discovers and burns it. Ila then starts feeling labor pains and gives birth to twin girls. In the meantime Ham has called Noah telling him the beasts are awake and eating each other. Tubal-cain emerges and attempts to hit Noah. Noah and Tubal-cain engage in combat. Shem promises Ila that Noah will not harm their daughters and goes to stop him. He attacks Noah as Tubal-cain falls to the ground only to be knocked out. Tubal-cain eventually forces Noah to the edge of the raft but Ham kills him with a dagger before he can shove Noah in the ocean. Noah picks himself up and immediately goes to find Ila and the babies. He is confronted by his wife who lies and tells him it was a boy but he does not believe her. He goes to find Ila on top of the ark she cries and tells him to wait to kill them until she can calm them down as she doesn't want them to die crying. Noah prepares to stab Ila's twins but he spares them upon looking at his granddaughters and only feeling love. Upon exiting the ark on the new land a shameful Noah goes into isolation in a nearby cave making wine in which to drown his sorrows. Ham expresses disappointment for his father's current state of unseemly drunkenness and nakedness before leaving his kin to live alone. Having reconciled at the behest of Ila Noah blesses the family as the beginning of a new human race and all witness an immense rainbow.
